" Early Abiy Ahmed tenure was characterized by major reforms in human rights, including releasing several political prisoners that were detained by EPRDF regime. After the Tigrayan rebels captured Amhara Region, Abiy declared state of emergency on 2 November 2021, encouraging mass arrests individuals ""suspected of collaborating with terrorist groups"" without warrant. The US government, various human rights groups and mainstream media accused the declaration of ethnic profiling against Tigrayans. Secret vigilantes operated in Addis Ababa and submitted individuals to the government supposed supporting the TPLF and OLA rebels. Tigrayan civilians were mostly detained in Western Tigray Zone. The detentions continued after the state of emergency in the capital Addis Ababa, targeting towards to some UN staffs members who were taken from their homes. According to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, 16 staff members of Ethiopian citizen detained while six others were freed. On 20 May 2022, Brigadier General Tefera Mamo, who led the Amharan army against Tigrayan force during the Tigray War, was arrested after a comment criticizing Abiy and his affiliation in Amhara region of being ""motivated by money"". Also, by 23 May 2022, the number of arrest has been inclined; 4,500 journalists and activists were arrested in what is called ""law enforcement operations"" by the government. While Abiy state the mass arrest is justified because of stability and security reasons, critics accused the government of utterly human rights violation, including extrajudicial killings. On 5 January 2023, the Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO) experts Daniel Tesfaye, Bezuayehu Wondimu, Bereket Daniel and Nahom Husen went to a village called Alem Bank in west Addis Ababa to investigate people whose houses are demolished by the Addis Ababa municipal government. While gathering information around, unidentified police forces detained the four and forcefully disappeared for several hours until they relocated to Gelan Gudan Police Station. They were brought in Sebeta police station. Police alleged that they haven't permission letters to inform Oromia authority to carry out investigation."

 In 1878, the Oviedo City Council received an application for permission to build the mining railway on Monte Naranco, which raised concerns as it was feared that the construction of the railway would affect the water supply of Fitoria, as it ran parallel to that of the future railway line. On 1 February 1880, the original 7,101-metre (7,766 yd) long mining railway between the Villapérez area and the northern station of Oviedo operated by the Compañía de los Ferrocarriles de Asturias, Galicia y León was inaugurated with an original length of 7.1 km (4.4 mi). The total cost of building the railway was 129,906 pesetas, including 19,798 pesetas for expropriations.

 One of the former shaft buildings had been converted into a casino and ballroom; it was demolished in the 1980s due to its dilapidated state. After the closure of the coalfields, the stables opposite the old shaft were bought by a private owner before being destroyed by fire. The ruins remained until they were demolished on May 31, 2006. At the beginning of the 21st century, no trace of the installations remained (apart from the ruins of a small outbuilding) and the shaft was located under a pavilion at the foot of a hill. In September 2012, a commemorative monument to early mining was built near the old shaft. It is made up of two minecarts and a wood framing.

 Shortly after its establishment, the bubble economy collapsed, and it was affected by the Heisei recession and the lost decade that came after. After that, in addition to the recession, there were circumstances unique to the industry, such as construction work to support digital terrestrial broadcasting and a shift away from television. Many stations are small. Also, in the analog era, there were few relay stations Many broadcasting stations do not include all households in broadcast area. For this reason, in areas where direct reception is impossible, install a high-gain antenna in a higher position, rebroadcast cable TV, or even receive it at existing stations in surrounding prefectures. Even in the new Heisei station, there are special circumstances due to geographical relationships. Furthermore, for the above reasons, the scale of the company itself is small, and it tends to have weaker program production and sales capabilities than the TV and radio stations that have opened earlier. In addition, the stations that opened in the latter half of the 1990s were affected by the Heisei recession and were established in a smaller and more compact manner. Low number of employees Headquarters building is small or simple There are few branch offices and branch office networksand other features. As for ITV, for a while the master was placed at an affiliated station outside the prefecture. In contrast to the Nippon TV series (NNN/NNS) and TBS series (JNN), which have many starting stations, and the Fuji TV series (FNN/FNS), which expanded its network with the issuance of a large number of UHF station licenses, the TV Asahi series (ANN) network Expansion was delayed. For this reason, Heisei new stations have the most ANN member stations (out of 24 stations, 11 stations are ANN member stations). Of the 24 Fullnet stations, half joined the Heisei period. In addition, in contrast to the long-established stations led by local newspaper companies, most of the Heisei new stations' major shareholders have key stations and major affiliated stations in the top three. In addition, there are few other affiliated programs on the net, and the proportion of in-house produced programs is also small. Although the number is small, there are newspaper companies that are closely related to the Heisei Shinkyoku (Hokkoku Shimbun, Nagasaki Shimbun, Okinawa Times, etc.). Most of the Heisei new stations have not listed.	Shortly after its establishment, the bubble economy collapsed, and it was affected by the Heisei recession and the lost decade that came after .

" In an interview with series creator Reki Kawahara, the author noted that the female characters in Sword Art Online were not based on anyone he knew in the real world, with him stating ""I don’t usually make a character, setting, or anything before I start writing. As I write the story, the girls become what they are now. So, somehow, I don’t know exactly, but somehow, my subliminal idea or some hidden emotion creates the characters to be strong and capable."" Kawahara also added that he wrote the series to demonstrate that he views online gaming not as a social ill or escape from real life, and thus decided to show games in a more positive light in his light novels."	Sword Art Online, a light novel series set in the world of online gaming, has been released in Japan for the first time, and it has been praised for its strong female characters.
" In 2011, The Alaska Design Forum, in collaboration with the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), embarked on a public art project that aimed to ignite conversations about shared spaces. This project resulted in a giant banner with the words ""Looking For Love Again"" hanging on the west face of the Polaris Building. The project sought to engage the public in a meaningful way and was designed by Candy Chang, a graphic and urban designer known for her work in struggling communities. The project featured two chalkboards at the base of the building, inviting passersby to share their memories and hopes related to the Polaris Building. Drawing inspiration from a similar endeavor in New Orleans, Candy Chang sought to evoke a sense of community ownership and empowerment by encouraging individuals to articulate their desires for their neighborhood. The 40 by 80-foot ""Looking For Love Again"" banner was vandalized and cut down in the summer of 2014."	Alaska's Polaris Building is one of the most iconic buildings in the state and has been the subject of a series of public art projects over the past five years.
 The economy prior to the eighteenth century was essentially a subsistence economy, which was also very much subject to the vagaries of geopolitics, which meant that attention was focused on ways of allocating resources to activities that produced food or strengthened the means of defence. As a result, cultural activities that detracted from production, defence or religion were generally viewed with suspicion, except by mercantilists, who saw them as a way of improving the trade balance. Cultural activities were seen as deeply linked to the passions, and as an expression of vices such as jealousy, envy, pride and lust, they were seen as something to be fought. So when Jean Bodin ranked city dwellers in order of social merit in 1576, he placed artists at the bottom. Even Bernard Mandeville, for whom the organisation of selfish passions is the driving force behind economic growth, only advises indulging in the arts as a means of avoiding other, more costly extravagances.However, both of these authors were interested in the problem of determining the price of works of art. For Bodin, the value of works of art or luxury items was essentially determined by demand, which in turn was linked to trends. Anticipating Veblen, he highlighted the conspicuous consumption dimension of the artistic demand of his time: it was all about flaunting one's wealth. Mandeville, for his part, also noted that an artist's reputation and the social position of his buyers had a major influence on the value placed on his work. To these determinants, he adds rarity, but also the conformity of the work to its model. In this, he agrees with Jean Bodin and Ferdinando Galiani that the fundamental value of art lies in its ability to highlight and exalt the true nature of its model and to educate viewers about virtue through its power to represent elevated feelings.

" The uprising was subject to intense criticism from Ukrainian left-wing nationalist figures. Mykhailo Hrushevsky, Ukrainian head of state prior to Skoropadskyi's coup d'état, allegedly described it as the ""darkest moment of the Ukrainian revolution."" The left wing of the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party also condemned the uprising as ""counter-revolutionary."" The Ukrainian populace reacted with ambivalence, by this point exhausted after a year of political turmoil, though Petliura faced criticism in non-partisan press organs. The remaining German soldiers in Kyiv, seeking to evacuate after the collapse of the German Empire, were primarily concerned with the continued operation of the Korosten railway station, which would allow them to return to Germany. Converesely, in Bolshevik circles, the uprising was met with support. Prior to the uprising's beginning, Bolsheviks Christian Rakovsky and Dmitry Manuilsky met with the Directorate's leaders, where they agreed to support the Directorate through ceasefire violations and recognition of the Ukrainian People's Republic in return for the legalisation of the Communist Party of Ukraine. These agreements were a tactical move by the Bolsheviks, as part of a broader campaign to weaken Ukrainian nationalists and strengthen the position of communist insurgent groups. Other left-wing groups from throughout the Russian Empire, including the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and anarchists, also supported the uprising."

" Chris Sims praised the graphic novel while writing for ComicsAlliance; he admitted to initial concern that either the false comic strip or the metafictional history would overshadow the other but found they meshed perfectly, surmising that Goldtiger was ""a book that's more than the sum of its parts. It manages to be a thrilling throwback adventure, a meta-commentary, and the story of two damaged, incompatible creators all at once, and despite my initial misgivings, it's impossible to separate all of those stories out from each other"". Ian Keogh also lauded Goldtiger, calling it ""a very clever and stylish pastiche"", also noting how well the strips and purported production material complemented each other."

" In poem 3.13 Sulpicia calls herself ""Sulpicia daughter of Servius"" (Servi filia Sulpicia), and in poem 3.13 she addresses Messalla (presumably Tibullus's patron Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, consul in 31 BC) as propinque ""relative"". On this basis Haupt (1871) identified Sulpicia as the granddaughter of Cicero's friend, Servius Sulpicius Rufus (consul 51 BC), who died in 43 BC, whose son is said to have married Messalla's sister. If so, Sulpicia would have been Messalla's niece. Some scholars write that she was Servius Sulpicius Rufus's daughter; if so, this would make Messalla her brother-in-law. Cērinthus, from the Greek κήρινθος ""bee bread"", is thought to be a synonym. Because of the similarity of consonants (c, r, n, t), as well as the metrical equivalence of the two names, and the resemblance between Greek κέρας keras ""horn"" and Latin cornu ""horn"", it has been suggested that Cerinthus may be the same as the friend, Cornutus, to whom Tibullus addresses a birthday poem (Tibullus 2.2), as well as a longer poem (2.3). The close verbal echoes between 2.2 and the some of the poems in the Garland (see below) are also suggestive that the works are in some way connected and that Cornutus and Cerinthus are the same person. One suggestion (if the Garland dates from the time of Tibullus) is that the Garland may have been written to celebrate the anniversary of Sulpicia and Cornutus's marriage."	Sulpicia may have been the granddaughter of Cicero's friend, Servius Sulpicius Rufus, who died in 43 BC . Some scholars write that she was her niece .
 The village of Tanuševci became involved in conflict on 17 February 2001, when masked NLA militants entered the area and kidnapped a TV filming crew. In response, Macedonian police attempted to enter the village on the same day but were met with fierce gunfire from the NLA militants, sparking the beginning of the battle in the village. On February 26, 2001, Macedonian forces engaged in battle with the NLA that lasted for several hours. Ultimately, the Macedonian forces succeeded in forcing the NLA to retreat across the border into Kosovo. Shortly after their retreat to Kosovo, the NLA made another attempt to gain control over the village once more and as of 1 March 2001, the NLA expelled the Macedonian forces and established control over Tanuševci.

 The slow transition from small foraging and hunter/gathering groups to more advanced agricultural societies began four to six thousand years ago in the Amazon Basin, with the exact timing varying by sub-region. These more advanced farming systems involved intensive arboriculture as well as staple root and seed crops that supported stable settlements with relatively large populations. Reports by early European explorers described large “well-fed populations along the bluffs, surrounded by orchards on the uplands and seasonal fields in the floodplains.” As elsewhere in the Americas, the European conquest brought the collapse of indigenous populations and their advanced agricultural systems were largely forgotten. Starting in roughly the year 2000, formal research projects (using molecular data, microfossil botanical techniques, remote sensing, and plant genetics) have resurrected the story of human settlement of the Amazon Basin – it is no longer thought to have been a primeval forest at the time of European contact and can now be considered, along with Mesoamerica, as an “early and independent cradle of agriculture”.The principal features of these agricultural practices are as follows:	The slow transition from small foraging and hunter/gathering groups to more advanced agricultural societies began four to six thousand years ago in the Amazon Basin .

 Alongwith many classic shloka from Bhagvad Gita, the following shloka has a great significance:- Following is the English translation of the shloka:- O Arjuna! You have the right to perform your own duty! But you should not be concerned about it's outcomes. Never be motivated by the results of your actions, nor should you be attached to not performing your prescribed duties. The shloka was widely used in India. It was the introductory theme song of BR Chopra's B.R. Films. The shloka was used in S.S. Rajamouli's 2022- Telugu Movie RRR, by Ram Charan. Furthermore, the shloka was widely used at different times and by many politicians in India. Prominent Indian Independence Movement leader, Mahatma Gandhi's interpretation of the Sankhya Yoga chapter in the Bhagavad Gita revolved around selfless action, non-attachment, and the concept of duty. He believed that individuals should focus on performing their responsibilities without being attached to the results. This philosophy guided his approach to nonviolent resistance, where actions were taken with sincerity and without the desire for personal gain. The Mahatma Gandhi emphasized the importance of self-discipline and renunciation of material desires, aligning with the Gita's teachings on detachment. His legacy in Sankhya Yoga lies in his application of these principles to social and political activism, advocating for justice, equality, and freedom through peaceful means. This interpretation continues to inspire individuals globally to engage in selfless service and contribute to positive societal change.	The shloka was widely used in India. It was used in S.S.

" The game consists of four quadrants: four players choose their own squares; begins with the 4th square diagonally serving to the 2nd square; the 2nd then returns the ball with one hit to any square to start the rally. When the ball lands in a player’s square they are eliminated, and the player in the 4th square always scores a point but only if the player in the 4th square is not eliminated (otherwise, no points are received by any); the remaining three players all rotate clockwise, and the eliminated player keeps their points but goes back to the 1st square OR is replaced by a new player in the 1st square. The game is played to 11 points (win by 2). A player is eliminated when: the ball lands on the ground inside their own square; player returns the ball out of bounds; failing to hit the ball into another square; double hitting the ball; hitting the ball incorrectly; or hitting the ball out of turn. The ball is considered in play when the ball lands on the outside boundary. Players are not allowed to catch, hold, or carry the ball at any point during play. Players are required to hit the ball with their ""hands"", which is any section between the fingertips and wrists, including the back of the hands."	In our series of letters from African Nations, we explain why the game is played to 11 points (win by 2).
" Addressing feudalism would necessitate a distinct kind of association with England. Historically, the fidelity of the local lords played a pivotal role in the Channel Islands' choice to remain under the English monarch. Central to this intricate relationship is the practice and importance of fiefs, deeply ingrained in Norman tradition. In Normandy, and subsequently in the Channel Islands, fiefs were deemed of utmost significance, as eloquently described in the Coutume de Normandie (the legal customs of Normandy): ""Je ne sais pas quelles sont ces dignités qui peuvent être possédés sans fond ni glebe, et pour lesquelles on doit hommage et non relief, à la réserve de certaines sargenteries qui n'ont point de glebe. Ces fiefs en l'air sont fiefs impropres; proprie enim feudum in rebus soli constitit.""transl. ""I do not know what these dignities are that can be held without foundation or glebe, and for which homage is due and not relief, except for certain sargenteries that have no glebe. These floating fiefs are improper fiefs; for a proper fief rests on tangible assets."" The Coutume elucidates the divergence between Norman and English practices: ""(en Normandie) on n'en use pas comme en Angleterre, où les dignités des Ducs & Comtes ne sont pas attachées aux fiefs. Ce sont des dignités personnelles que le ROI donne à qui lui plaît, et tel s'appelle Duc & comte de Warwick, de Northumberland... mais même n'y a rien du tout.""transl. ""(In Normandy) they do not operate as they do in England, where the titles of Dukes & Counts aren't tethered to fiefs. These are personal titles bestowed by the KING at his discretion, and someone might be named Duke & Count of Warwick, Northumberland... yet they don't hold any tangible property."" This distinction rests upon the inherent value placed on possessing glebe (landed estates) in the Channel Islands. While firmly rooted in Norman traditions, it contrasts sharply with the English approach. The Channel Islands' feudal tradition is commonly recognized as one of the unique characteristics that distinguish the islands and grants them a special status. As C. Northcote Parkinson once remarked: ""Without its feudalism, Guernsey as a tourist resort would be little different from Bognor Regis."""	The issue of feudalism in the Channel Islands has been a major source of controversy since the island's creation in the early 19th Century, and has been the subject of much debate in recent years.
 The cave is located in the Thal-Kittelsthal karst complex, a former Zechstein reef. This region was in a threshold position at the beginning of the Zechstein period; Thuringia was covered by the Zechstein Sea, which had only a shallow water depth in this threshold region. In these shallow water areas, favored by the climatic conditions, many calcareous coral reef found a habitat. These reef-builders died off under increasingly inhospitable living conditions and were gradually covered by sediments of the higher Zechstein. The Thuringian Forest was uplifted by Saxonian fracture block tectonics; to a lesser extent this also affected areas of the foreland such as the Kittelsthal region, parts of which were later eroded again. This provided favorable conditions for karstification. Water sank over fissures and ponors in the reef complex and the dripstone caves began to form. In larger cavities, the dissolution of the limestone by carbonic acid formed stalactites, stalagmites and stalagnates of various sizes and shapes. In the cave there are also sporadic eccentrics, sideways or upward curved outgrowths of a few centimeters in length, independent of gravity.

" The building of the museum was originally a house established by a merchant named ""Abd al-Jabbar al-Khudairi"" in the late 19th century. It at one point belonged to Halil Kut of the Ottoman Empire. The house became a distinguished heritage building in terms of planning, architectural elements, distinguished woodwork, shanasheel, and the neighborhoods where the house was located. The Ministry of Tourism maintained the house and revived it as a heritage museum for Abd-al Karim Qasim. The museum contains Qasim's personal belongings and rare gifts. After maintenance, the museum was opened on the 9th of February, 2015, and was attended by his family and loved ones, as well as official, academic and cultural figures. The museum was opened to preserve the history of the country so that future generations can be aware of it. It also hinted that a similar museum in Basra dedicated to poet Badr Shakir al-Sayyab could be opened. The museum includes five halls, the first of which included the personal belongings of the leader, and the other was allocated for gifts, weapons, archives, and documents."

 In December of that year, They crossed the Heilong River and were stationed in the Russian Free City Srabske area. With the help of 500,000 Koreans and the Russian Red Army, they received weapons replenishment and sometimes participated in joint operations. Meanwhile, in February 1921, a military agreement was signed between the buffer government in Chita and the anti-Japanese independence army through the good offices of Ohamuk, a graduate of the Russian Military Academy who participated in the Russian Revolution. According to this military agreement, the independence army received weapons from them, established the Goryeo Revolutionary Military Academy (高麗革命軍官學校) to train the independence army, and participated in the subjugation of the Baekgye Army. Knowing this, Japan launched a robust diplomatic offensive against the Russian government and demanded that it disarm. Meanwhile, Russia, anxious about domestic civil war after the revolution, was wary of discord with Japan and promised to disarm the Korean Independence Army. Accordingly, on June 22, 1921, the Russian authorities issued an order to the Korean independence forces stationed in Heilongjiang Jayu City to disarm and, at the same time, attack and defeat the resisting independence forces, causing the Jayu City Incident. At this time, the Independence Army units suffered many casualties and suffered untold hardships, causing the Korean Independence Corps to disintegrate.

 Innovation in a given language, most particularly in the prose of specialized subjects, does not normally occur in a vacuum; that is, so-called nonce-formations and compounding predominantly arise in more literary modes, such as epic poetry or drama (tragic or comic, etc.) rather than technical prose. Instead, novel technical terms are introduced most commonly as a result of language contact, e.g. the influence of a source language on a target language (Ancient Greek on Latin, German on English, etc.). This novelty is not always formal, e.g. neologisms or loan-words, but conceptual too, augmenting the existing meaning of words in the target language so as to accommodate or include new concepts introduced exogenously into the target language's lexicon. This phenomenon is an ancient one, proving to be decisive in the origins of Western Europe's philosophical and scientific vocabulary, for example. Many of the Ancient Greeks' original neologisms and novel meanings came to generate continual and permanent influence on Latin writers and, thence, on local languages across Europe in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.	A novel technical term is one that has been introduced into a language by contact with the language's existing lexicon, e.g. by the influence of a source language on a target language.

 The building has three levels, developing on a rectangular floor plan 40 m long and 13 m wide. On the east front, it has a columned portico developed on five round arches, placed asymmetrically, with a wooden trussed ceiling. The top floor consists of a loggia extending across the entire surface of the villa, covered by wooden trusses supporting the roof pitches. A cross-vaulted cellar extends only partially over a square portion of the roof. The only vertical connection prior to the 20th century restoration (which saw the introduction of a three-flight internal staircase) was the external staircase in the forepart at the end of the southern façade. Some frescoes preserved inside the ladies' room constitute a very rare example of the depiction of the leisure and occupations of the ladies of the court: they depict moments of the mistress's day, from waking up accompanied by music, to playing chess, to preparing the nuptial bed. They are considered one of the best Lombard fresco cycles of the entire 15th century.	The building has three levels, developing on a rectangular floor plan 40 m long and 13 m wide .

 Smith Bagley was born in New York to Nancy Susan Reynolds, the daughter of R. J. Reynolds, and Henry Walker Bagley, a businessman from Greenwich, Connecticut. He was a graduate of Washington and Lee University. Bagley had homes in the Massachusetts towns of Georgetown and Nantucket, and also owned the Reynolds family, Musgrove on St. Simons Island. The family estate was the site of Jimmy Carter's first pre-inauguration meeting, and was later a regular retreat for Democratic policymakers and activists.Bagley first married Sandra Peabody Robinson, though the relationship ended in a divorce. He then married Vicki Lynn Ladmer in 1966, who he also later divorced. He married Elizabeth Frawley Bagley, nearly twenty years his junior, in 1983.	John Smith Bagley, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has died at the age of 83... and his wife, Elizabeth, has announced his death.
" In 1918, Wimble built a small ship at Hastings with help from a friend and sailed to the West Indies to seek his fortune after his family faced financial hardship. In 1922, he acquired land in the Bahamas which enabled him to begin trading with the English colonies in mainland North America. He also acquired land in North Carolina, which was formally granted to him by George Burrington's council on August 4, 1723. Wimble later moved to Boston, Massachusetts where he married Rebecca Waters, the daughter of a prominent local, on March 26, 1724. Their first son, James, was born on December 20, 1724. He owned land in the South End which he presumably operated as a distillery. While in Boston, he continued his business of moving trade goods between North Carolina and various British trade posts in the West Indies. This business enabled him to increase his land holdings in North Carolina and purchase a brigantine, which he named ""Rebecca"" after his wife. In 1932, Wimble lost his ship and all of its cargo to a hurricane after being forced by Governor Woodes Rogers of the Bahamas to use his ship to protect vessels and salt ponds in Rum Cay. Wimble was forced to sell a portion of his belongings, land, and slaves to cover the loss and began the process of trying to collect damages from Woodes Rogers' commandeering of his ship."

" The uprising was subject to intense criticism from Ukrainian left-wing nationalist figures. Mykhailo Hrushevsky, Ukrainian head of state prior to Skoropadskyi's coup d'état, allegedly described it as the ""darkest moment of the Ukrainian revolution."" The left wing of the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party also condemned the uprising as ""counter-revolutionary."" The Ukrainian populace reacted with ambivalence, by this point exhausted after a year of political turmoil, though Petliura faced criticism in non-partisan press organs. The remaining German soldiers in Kyiv, seeking to evacuate after the collapse of the German Empire, were primarily concerned with the continued operation of the Korosten railway station, which would allow them to return to Germany. Converesely, in Bolshevik circles, the uprising was met with support. Prior to the uprising's beginning, Bolsheviks Christian Rakovsky and Dmitry Manuilsky met with the Directorate's leaders, where they agreed to support the Directorate through ceasefire violations and recognition of the Ukrainian People's Republic in return for the legalisation of the Communist Party of Ukraine. These agreements were a tactical move by the Bolsheviks, as part of a broader campaign to weaken Ukrainian nationalists and strengthen the position of communist insurgent groups. Other left-wing groups from throughout the Russian Empire, including the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and anarchists, also supported the uprising."	The Ukrainian authorities have held a demonstration in the capital, Kyiv, against the collapse of the German Empire.
 Born in 1941 in Thiès, Senegal, Sow studied filmmaking in Paris at the Conservatoire libre du cinéma français (CLCF, fr) and subsequently worked in French and Senegalese television. He directed documentary shorts and three feature films on his own: Guereo, village de Djibril N'Diaye (1970), L'Option / Mon beau pays (1974), and L'Œil (1981). Sow is best known for the historical drama film Camp de Thiaroye about the Thiaroye massacre near Dakar on December 1, 1944, which he cowrote and codirected with Ousmane Sembène. It won the Grand Special Jury Prize at the 45th Venice International Film Festival in 1988.

" Andrews returned to his education in 1994. He pursued a PhD in chemistry at Stanford University under the direction of Steven Boxer, which he completed in 2001. His research focused on the effects of electric fields on molecular vibrations, called the vibrational Stark effect, which he investigated with infrared spectroscopy. In the process, he developed a liquid nitrogen immersion cryostat and novel FTIR scanning methods. After earning his PhD, Andrews switched fields to systems biology. This started with post-doctoral research in Dennis Bray's laboratory at the University of Cambridge (2001-2003), where he investigated spatial aspects of cell signaling. As part of this work, he developed a spatially detailed biochemical simulator called Smoldyn, a project that has continued to be a major part of his career. Andrews followed this position with several others: more post-doctoral research in Adam Arkin's laboratory at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (2003-2007), a visiting scientist position at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (2007), a staff scientist position at the Molecular Sciences Institute (2008-2009), a staff scientist position in Roger Brent's laboratory at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (2009-2016), a physics teaching position at Seattle University (2015-2020), and his current scientist position in Herbert Sauro's laboratory at the University of Washington (2020-). Andrews's research has continued to focus on algorithm and software development for spatially detailed biochemical modeling, including particle, filament, and surface dynamics. His software, Smoldyn, is used for biophysics and cell modeling research. Andrews has also worked on non-spatial biochemical models. For example, in work with Roger Brent, he found that symmetric ""push-pull"" reaction mechanisms are able to make biochemical signaling outputs depend linearly on their inputs."	Disclosed herein are methods and algorithms for spatially detailed biochemical modeling, including particle filament, and surface dynamics. Also disclosed are methods and algorithms for non-spatial biochemical models.
 Under a certain number of visitors, the marginal cost of an additional visitor is negligible compared to the cost of preserving the collection. Thus, asking each visitor to pay an amount corresponding to the average cost of the museum would exclude many potential visitors with a low willingness to pay for an additional visit. As a result, most museums have a pricing policy based on price discrimination between occasional visitors, who often have a high willingness to pay (if a visit to the museum is an essential part of a holiday in the city concerned, for example), and potentially more regular visitors, whose number of visits depends on the cost of the additional visit. In most cases, this policy takes the form of a two-part tariff structure, with a single ticket on the one hand, and a subscription offering unlimited access to all or part of the museum's collections on the other. In addition to income from admission, museums have long been dependent on either the public authorities or wealthy patrons to finance part of their operating costs. Since the mid-1980s, budgetary stringency has reduced public subsidies, while museum costs have risen as a result of both the increasing sophistication of preservation techniques and the sheer cost of building maintenance. At the same time, sponsorship is increasingly focused on operations (building construction, performances, temporary exhibitions) that provide a showcase. As a result, museums relying essentially on their own resources have increasingly turned to modest and numerous donations, in return for a policy of openness to as many people as possible.

" The term ""Karma Yoga"" is derived from two Sanskrit words: ""Karma"" and ""Yoga."" In Sanskrit, ""Karma"" means action or deed. It refers to the actions or activities performed by an individual, including their thoughts, words, and physical actions. ""Yoga"" means union or connection. It signifies the process of uniting the individual self (atman) with the universal consciousness or the Divine (Brahman). When combined, ""Karma Yoga"" can be understood as the path of selfless action, where an individual performs their duties and responsibilities without attachment to the results, aiming to attain spiritual growth and union with the Divine. It emphasizes the importance of performing actions as a service or offering to the Divine, without seeking personal gains or rewards."

" On April 8, the Ottoman army passed Ochkhamuri, but did not go through the valley and took refuge in the forest between Ochkhamuri and Cholok. Mazniashvili ordered the armored train to retreat. The armored personnel carrier was supposed to be in the rearguard, but then he shared the plan of Vladimir Goguadze, the head of the armored personnel carrier: To break into the enemy's positions and conduct a battle. The battle began at five o'clock in the morning on April 7. An armored train broke into the ranks of the enemy. But the Georgian side did not open fire either from the train or from the trenches, because it had received such an order. Only the artillery, which was handed over to Kargaretli, opened fire on the opponent. Whether the Ottomans approached the train or not, they opened fire. The Georgians opened fire from the train as well as from trenches and trenches. The Ottoman soldiers found in the open field were killed in large numbers. After six hours of the battle, an Ottoman dragster hit the armored car and threw the first car of the train off the tracks, and another attack was made on the armored car by a new thousand from the west. Goguadze had run out of hope and pressed the button with which the armored personnel carrier was supposed to explode, the enemy would only be left with iron fragments, but the wire leading from the remote control to the mine was broken and the mine did not come into action. In the meantime, Akaki Urushadze, who was sent to ask for additional help, came to Mazniashvili and a 400-man detachment of the Gori Guard joined the battle. The Ottomans finally broke and began to retreat. The Georgians came out of the trenches and reached the fleeing enemy to the bridge of Ochkhamuri before 4 o'clock in the day. The Ottoman army retreated 4 kilometers. In the battle, 3 people were killed and 25 wounded on the Georgian side. On the side of the Ottomans, according to Mazniashvili's estimate, up to 500 people were killed, and according to other Georgian military leaders, up to 1000 people were killed. According to Dr. Vakhtang Gambashidze, the Ottomans were transporting 600 wounded soldiers to Batumi. According to ""Georgia"" newspaper, 80 were killed on the Ottoman side, 2 soldiers were captured. Georgians captured 20 rifles."	On April 8, the Ottoman army passed Ochkhamuri, but did not go through the valley and took refuge in the forest .

 Entering service on 22 April 1985 on the Bluemull Sound service, taking over from the original MV Geira, which was then sold out of the fleet. She operated alone on the Gutcher, Yell - Belmont, Unst - Oddsta, Fetlar service until 1988 when she was joined by MV Fylga. Once the two new Yell ferries were introduced in 2004, MV Bigga replaced Fylga on the service. This is the same year that the Fetlar terminal changed from Oddsta to Hamars Ness. Due to a vessel change, on 3 October 2005, Fivla was relegated to the fleet relief vessel, which she still operates as today. Each month she covers a different ro-ro ferry in the fleet so that they can go for their annual refit. She also covers any breakdowns that occur across the fleet. The only rest the ferry gets is when she goes for her own annual refit, normally on the Malakoff slip in Lerwick. On 28 April 2010, while carrying out refit cover in Yell Sound, she was trapped underneath the linkspan in Toft. This was due to four preventer chains on the linkspan snapping simultaneously from the low spring tides and the lower freeboard of the relief vessel. Due to this, during the following days (29 April and 4 May 2010), she operated a special service between Vidlin and Ulsta, Yell. == References ==	MV Fivla entered service on 22 April 1985 on the Bluemull Sound service, taking over from the original MV Geira, which was then sold out of the fleet .

" The Marble Palace is open to the public and tourists two days a year: January 16 and January 17. These two days are nationally recognized as ""the days of the martyrs"" and are dedicated to the memory of two martyrs. The first martyr is Patrice Émery Lumumba, who was assassinated in Lubumbashi on January 17, 1961. The second martyr is Laurent-Désiré Kabila, who was assassinated at the Marble Palace on January 16, 2001. The Palace has been carefully preserved, including the bloodstained chair. Parenthetically, the palace displays a collection of photographs documenting Laurent-Désiré Kabila's political struggle, from his time in the maquis to his eventual seizure of power on May 17, 1997. There are also various works of art created in honor of his legacy. The visit is extremely popular, with thousands visiting the site each year. == References =="	The Marble Palace of Lubumbashi has been officially opened to the public for the first time since the end of the 1960s.
 In December of that year, They crossed the Heilong River and were stationed in the Russian Free City Srabske area. With the help of 500,000 Koreans and the Russian Red Army, they received weapons replenishment and sometimes participated in joint operations. Meanwhile, in February 1921, a military agreement was signed between the buffer government in Chita and the anti-Japanese independence army through the good offices of Ohamuk, a graduate of the Russian Military Academy who participated in the Russian Revolution. According to this military agreement, the independence army received weapons from them, established the Goryeo Revolutionary Military Academy (高麗革命軍官學校) to train the independence army, and participated in the subjugation of the Baekgye Army. Knowing this, Japan launched a robust diplomatic offensive against the Russian government and demanded that it disarm. Meanwhile, Russia, anxious about domestic civil war after the revolution, was wary of discord with Japan and promised to disarm the Korean Independence Army. Accordingly, on June 22, 1921, the Russian authorities issued an order to the Korean independence forces stationed in Heilongjiang Jayu City to disarm and, at the same time, attack and defeat the resisting independence forces, causing the Jayu City Incident. At this time, the Independence Army units suffered many casualties and suffered untold hardships, causing the Korean Independence Corps to disintegrate.	During World War One, the Korean independence army was supported by the buffer government in Chita in the north-east of the country, which was established by the Russian Revolution in 1917.
" In 1577, William Camden (1551–1623) began his great work Britannia, a topographical and historical survey of all of Great Britain and Ireland. His stated intention was to ""restore antiquity to Britaine, and Britain to his antiquity"". The first edition, written in Latin, was published in 1586. It proved very popular, and ran through five further Latin editions, of 1587, 1590, 1594, 1600 and 1607, each greatly enlarged from its predecessor in both textual content and illustrations. The 1607 edition included for the first time a full set of English county maps, based on the surveys of Christopher Saxton and John Norden, and engraved by William Kip and William Hole (who also engraved the fine frontispiece). The first English-language edition, translated by Philemon Holland, appeared in 1610, again with some additional content supplied by Camden. Britannia is a county-by-county description of Great Britain and Ireland. It is a work of chorography: a study that relates landscape, geography, antiquarianism, and history. Rather than write a history, Camden wanted to describe in detail the Great Britain of his time, and to show how the traces of the past could be discerned in the existing landscape. By this method, he produced the first coherent picture of Roman Britain."

 In 1989, Lessa joined the Scuderie Detetive Le Cocq, a death squad created in 1965 to avenge the death of detective Milton Le Cocq d'Oliveira and that aimed at avenging the deaths of police officers as well. He distinguished himself in police operations in drug-trafficking dominated favelas by taking possession of seized assets from the traffickers. In 1991, he joined the Military Police and was transferred to the Civil Police in 2003, where he served until his retirement in 2010. During his service in these law enforcement agencies, he received honors at Alerj (State Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro) and a commendation at the City Council of Rio de Janeiro. According to the 2019 account from an experienced civil police officer who worked with Lessa and preferred not to be identified for safety reasons: He felt like a soldier in the midst of the Vietnam War. We conducted several operations together with a large part of the specialized police stations of the Civil Police. Bullets were flying, and their group appeared in the worst situations. Lessa was a serial killer. He had taken several shots, but he remained standing. He was a true war soldier. A killing machine. In 2009, Ronnie Lessa suffered serious injuries after a grenade detonated inside his car in the neighborhood of Bento Ribeiro. In an interview with Veja magazine, when asked about his relationship with Jair Bolsonaro, Lessa said that he was assisted by the then federal deputy to receive treatment at the Brazilian Beneficent Association for Rehabilitation.Lessa is also under investigation for the execution of two individuals that allegedly took place during a police operation in the Parque Colúmbia favela in September 2000.

 Currently, the Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo forest is a large natural area and one of the largest recreational areas in the North West of Moscow along with Serebryany Bor. A linden park is on the north side of the manor house. Some very old trees have also been preserved there. The park has a variety of tree types, including pines, maples, larches, lindens, oaks, birchs, elms, cedars, spruces, and apple trees. Many local residents frequently visit the ponds located in the eastern part of the park. There is a beach area around a large pond, with some trees. The northern and northwestern parts of the park were created relatively recently where a mixed forest originally was. The layout has a system of paths. The northwestern natural boundary of the park is the Khimka River, the only clean source of drinking water in Moscow as of 2009. The spring has several water pipes, where residents of neighboring and remote areas can collect clean drinking water. The spring had a mosaic panel depicting a swan princess that was destroyed after updates were made to the spring.

 Innovation in a given language, most particularly in the prose of specialized subjects, does not normally occur in a vacuum; that is, so-called nonce-formations and compounding predominantly arise in more literary modes, such as epic poetry or drama (tragic or comic, etc.) rather than technical prose. Instead, novel technical terms are introduced most commonly as a result of language contact, e.g. the influence of a source language on a target language (Ancient Greek on Latin, German on English, etc.). This novelty is not always formal, e.g. neologisms or loan-words, but conceptual too, augmenting the existing meaning of words in the target language so as to accommodate or include new concepts introduced exogenously into the target language's lexicon. This phenomenon is an ancient one, proving to be decisive in the origins of Western Europe's philosophical and scientific vocabulary, for example. Many of the Ancient Greeks' original neologisms and novel meanings came to generate continual and permanent influence on Latin writers and, thence, on local languages across Europe in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.

 According to legend, seeds of cannabis were brought to Naogaon District for cultivation from Jessore District before 1857 and were first planted. However, according to history, after the establishment of a cannabis hub in Naogaon, Bengal Presidency in 1906, the government of the British Raj started the first commercial cultivation of cannabis in the region Bengal. The government then appointed a registrar to collect revenue from the hub. In 1917, a cooperative society named the Ganja Society was established for the welfare of the 7,000 cannabis growers of Naogaon. The shares of the co-operative society were then sold to the farmers at the rate of ten rupees each, whereby the farmers became its partners. A warehouse was built there to store the produced cannabis. It was inaugurated in 1921 by Syed Nawab Ali Chowdhury, one of the provincial ministers of Bengal. In 1974, the government of Bangladesh signed the Geneva Conventions, which forced the government to withdraw from cannabis production. In 1975, the Ganja Society set up a 1,000 metric ton capacity cold storage facility with three chambers. According to the agreement, the activities of the Ganja Society came to a standstill in 1987 when the cultivation of cannabis was banned. After the ban was announced, the government locked up the Ganja Society's warehouses with manufactured cannabis.	The Ganja Society, a cannabis farm in the southern Indian state of Bengal, has been established for the welfare of thousands of farmers.
 As early as 1911, the game was being played regularly at Oxford with records of the university's Australian rules football club's foundation dating to 1906. The Cambridge University Australian Rules Football Club is believed to have been founded around 1911. In 1911 Oxford University captained by Alfred Clemens defeated Cambridge University captained by Ron Larking 13.9 (87) to 5.12 (42). In 1914, H C A Harrison reported that the game was being played regularly at both Oxford and Cambridge universities though few records exist of contests between 1911 and 1921. After the war, in 1921, the Oxford University–Cambridge University Varsity match between expatriate Australian students became an annual contest. The 90th Varsity match was the subject of a short ABC documentary (Video on YouTube).	The present application is directed to the method of playing a football game. The method of playing a football game includes the steps of playing a first team of players on one side of the university, playing a second team of players on the other side of the university, and captaining the first team by captaining the second team captained by defeating the first team captained by defeating the first team captained by defeating the second team captained by defeating the first team captained by defeating the second team captained by defeating the first team captained by defeating the second team captained by defeating the first team captained by defeating the second team captained by defeating the first team captained by defeating the second team captained by defeating the first team captained by defeating the second team captained by defeating the first team captained by defeating the second team captained by defeating the first team captained by defeating the second team captained by defeating the first team captained by defeating the second team captained by defeating the first team captained by defeating the second team captained by defeating the first team captained by defeating the second team captained by defeating the first team captained by defeating the second team captained by defeating the first team captained by defeating the second team captained
 In the men's championship division finals, the 2000 champions, Penn State, would face North Carolina in their national finals debut. While all of Penn State's previous 5 games were within a goal, North Carolina would cut it much closer, requiring extra time in their previous two games, including a nine-round penalty shootout with Illinois in the semifinals. Despite playing nearly 30 extra minutes, North Carolina started early with a goal from Eric Rossitch in the 5th minute off of a header near the 6-yard box off of a free kick. A goal in the last minute by Daniel Goff while Penn State had all 11 men in North Carolina's half would see North Carolina win 2–0. This was North Carolina's first national title and the first national title by a Region II team, the only region who hadn't had a team claim a men's championship national title. In the women's championship finals, the 2012 champions, Michigan State, would face Colorado State who were looking on claiming their fourth national title. Both teams required extra time in the semifinals and Colorado State further needed penalty kicks to decide not only the semifinals, but also the quarterfinals. Following the trend for both teams, the game would remain 0-0 after 80 minutes, meaning extra time would be required. Four minutes into extra time, eventual MVP Danielle Manning of Michigan State would break the deadlock with a sudden-victory goal that gave Michigan State their second women's national title. Both of Michigan State's titles were won in extra time. In the men's open finals, Oregon would return to the open finals after their title 10 years ago in 2005 to face UC-Davis who were making their debut. Coming in, Oregon won each of their previous 5 games by at least 2 goals while UC-Davis had only given up a single goal. UC-Davis would go up 2–1 in the match, but Oregon's Henry Fassinger would score a penalty kick late into the game to tie the game at 2-2, forcing the game into extra time. Eventual MVP, Andrew Saenz of Oregon, would score a sudden-victory goal to secure Oregon's 3–2 win and their second national title.In the women's open finals, 2012 open champions, JMU, would face last year's open runners-up UCLA. Coming in, JMU would require a penalty shootout in the quarterfinals while UCLA required extra time in the semifinals. UCLA would redeem their finals loss the previous year and defeat JMU 2–0, claiming their second open title. Isis Piccillo of UCLA would be named MVP.	The 2012 men's and women's lacrosse national finals took place in Washington, DC, on Saturday, 1 July... and on Sunday, 2 July, in Baltimore, Maryland.
 Under a certain number of visitors, the marginal cost of an additional visitor is negligible compared to the cost of preserving the collection. Thus, asking each visitor to pay an amount corresponding to the average cost of the museum would exclude many potential visitors with a low willingness to pay for an additional visit. As a result, most museums have a pricing policy based on price discrimination between occasional visitors, who often have a high willingness to pay (if a visit to the museum is an essential part of a holiday in the city concerned, for example), and potentially more regular visitors, whose number of visits depends on the cost of the additional visit. In most cases, this policy takes the form of a two-part tariff structure, with a single ticket on the one hand, and a subscription offering unlimited access to all or part of the museum's collections on the other. In addition to income from admission, museums have long been dependent on either the public authorities or wealthy patrons to finance part of their operating costs. Since the mid-1980s, budgetary stringency has reduced public subsidies, while museum costs have risen as a result of both the increasing sophistication of preservation techniques and the sheer cost of building maintenance. At the same time, sponsorship is increasingly focused on operations (building construction, performances, temporary exhibitions) that provide a showcase. As a result, museums relying essentially on their own resources have increasingly turned to modest and numerous donations, in return for a policy of openness to as many people as possible.	In a museum, the number of times each visitor to the museum is asked to pay for an additional visit is inversely proportional to the cost of the additional visit.
 The Dunstan Mountains form the entrance to the Upper Clutha Valley. The northwest flank of the range is bound by a combination of Cluden Stream in the Lindis Valley, the Lindis River, the Clutha River (Māori: Mata-Au) and Lake Dunstan. Lake Dunstan follows the former Clutha River through the Cromwell Gorge demarcating the southwest limit of the mountains. The mountain range is bound to the east by the Manuherikia Valley and to the northeast by Dunstan Creek, which joins the Manuherikia River at Saint Bathans. The Dunstan Mountains are bisected by the 4-wheel drive Thomson Gorge Road which follows Thomsons Creek, incised into the eastern flank of the range and the Rise and Shine Creek on the western flank. Thomsons Saddle, between the two creeks, climbs to 980 m (3,220 ft) elevation. The summit landscape is generally a broad, gently sloping undulatory surface which climbs steadily from the west and falls sharply to the Manuherakia Valley floor on the east. The asymmetric nature of the Dunstan Mountains is common with most of Central Otago's basin and range mountains.	The Dunstan Mountains form the entrance to the Upper Clutha Valley .

 Henry Ross, who is believed to be the designer of the Eureka Flag, was from Toronto, Canada. The Swiss-born Charles Doudiet, whose sketchbook is held by the Art Gallery of Ballarat and contains such scenes from around the time of the armed uprising as the iconic Eureka Slaughter, had lived in Canada. Doudiet may have been present at the battle, and he notes in his sketchbook that he helped to convey his friend, the mortally wounded Ross, to the Free Trade Hotel, where the Eureka flag bearer died of a groin injury two days later. Robert Julien died defending the stockade, as did Thomas Budden, also a friend of Ross, both from Canada.	Swiss-born Charles Doudiet's sketchbook is held by the Art Gallery of Ballarat .

" People have willingly arranged to be buried alive, reportedly demonstrating their disputed ability to survive such an event for many centuries. The fear of being buried alive peaked during the cholera epidemics of the 19th century, but accounts of unintentional live burial have been recorded even earlier. Reports of doctors and accounts in literature heightened these fears. The subject is detailed in ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" and ""The Cask of Amontillado"", Edgar Allan Poe wrote ""The Premature Burial"", which was published in 1844. It contained accounts of supposedly genuine cases of premature burial and detailing the narrator's (perceived) interment while still alive. In 1822, German Dr. Adolf Gutsmuth was buried alive several times to demonstrate a safety coffin of his design, staying underground for several hours and eating a meal of soup, bratwurst, marzipan, sauerkraut, spätzle, beer, and for dessert, prinzregententorte, delivered to him through the coffin's feeding tube. In 1840, Sadhu Haridas, an Indian yogi, is said to have been buried for ten months. The yogi said that his only fear during his ""wonderful sleep"" was being eaten by underground worms. However, according to current medical science, a human can't survive for ten months without food, water, and air. According to other sources the entire burial was 40 days long. The Indian government has since made voluntary premature burial illegal because of the unintended deaths of individuals attempting to recreate this feat. In 1898, Russian Count Michel de Karnice-Karnicki invented a safety coffin called ""Le Karnice"". A long tube measuring 8.89 cm (3.5 in) in diameter was connected with an aperture in the coffin, with the other end emerging above ground (rather like the periscope of a submarine). Italian Faroppo Lorenzo consented to be buried in ""Le Karnice"". On 17 December 1898, he was buried and emerged on the 26th of December. Signor Lorenzo’s only comment, when dug up after this dismal underground Christmas vacation, was that it had been ""damned smelly down there""."	In our series of letters from African journalists, novelist and writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani looks at why people are buried alive.
" In 1577, William Camden (1551–1623) began his great work Britannia, a topographical and historical survey of all of Great Britain and Ireland. His stated intention was to ""restore antiquity to Britaine, and Britain to his antiquity"". The first edition, written in Latin, was published in 1586. It proved very popular, and ran through five further Latin editions, of 1587, 1590, 1594, 1600 and 1607, each greatly enlarged from its predecessor in both textual content and illustrations. The 1607 edition included for the first time a full set of English county maps, based on the surveys of Christopher Saxton and John Norden, and engraved by William Kip and William Hole (who also engraved the fine frontispiece). The first English-language edition, translated by Philemon Holland, appeared in 1610, again with some additional content supplied by Camden.Britannia is a county-by-county description of Great Britain and Ireland. It is a work of chorography: a study that relates landscape, geography, antiquarianism, and history. Rather than write a history, Camden wanted to describe in detail the Great Britain of his time, and to show how the traces of the past could be discerned in the existing landscape. By this method, he produced the first coherent picture of Roman Britain."

In March, photos in Los Angeles were published on her social networks, where she met several North American musicians, such as Timbaland, Tommy Brown and Njomza. In July, Sonza participated in a chat with her fans via Twitter, where she revealed that there were twenty-eight songs ready, but that not all of them would make the final version of the album. It was also mentioned that it would have more sensual and explicit music, songs in other languages and that part of the musical production will be done by Tommy Brown. Douglas Moda, one of the producers of her last album, is also confirmed for the new one. Sonza said the project translates to a ""crazy trip inside my head""."

" The Ius in Memoria are akin to Ius in Bello, in focusing more on the ""how"" of commemoration. It has four criteria: Transcend the Collectives. Commemoration is seen as ethical if it encourages people to treat each other as individuals rather than group representatives. Exit Circular Narratives. Commemoration should help people exit narratives that trap them in debilitating interpretative loops. Assert Moral Autonomy. Groups should justify their actions in universal terms, rather than excusing transgressions with reference to what others have done. Contained Unfathomability. Good commemoration should be precise with dates, locations and names to tether past trauma. Numerical aspects of trauma should typically be communicated in broad categories. Proponents of the approach argue that taken together, the framework can constitute a comprehensive ethical approach or paradigm for commemoration. They concede that critiques of the just war tradition also apply to this moral framework, in that both pacifist and realist/revolutionary alternatives retain their validity."

 The village of Tanuševci became involved in conflict on 17 February 2001, when masked NLA militants entered the area and kidnapped a TV filming crew. In response, Macedonian police attempted to enter the village on the same day but were met with fierce gunfire from the NLA militants, sparking the beginning of the battle in the village. On February 26, 2001, Macedonian forces engaged in battle with the NLA that lasted for several hours. Ultimately, the Macedonian forces succeeded in forcing the NLA to retreat across the border into Kosovo. Shortly after their retreat to Kosovo, the NLA made another attempt to gain control over the village once more and as of 1 March 2001, the NLA expelled the Macedonian forces and established control over Tanuševci.	The battle between Macedonian forces and the National Liberation Army (NLA) militants in a village in the eastern Kosovo region has ended.
 During the late 19th century, the growth of Oberschöneweide and Niederschöneweide was closely linked to the rapid expansion of Berlin's large-scale industry. The presence of railways and waterways provided favorable conditions for the establishment of industrial settlements. At the same time, however, constructing paths and roads and connecting them to the Chausseenetz of the district of Teltow became necessary. To create the first permanent link between the two banks of the Spree River, a chain ferry was established in 1885, and funded by the district. The ferry connection operated until 1891 when it was replaced by a wooden bridge in 1890/1891. This bridge also accommodated the tracks of the Oberschöneweide industrial railroad (Bullenbahn), which connected seventeen newly established factories in Oberschöneweide to the Berlin-Görlitz railroad line. The 121-meter-long bridge over the Spree was a wooden truss structure with nine openings, with three in the middle serving as ship passages. In addition to this bridge, other Spree crossings were built around the same time, such as the Kaisersteg (1898, pedestrian bridge) and the Treskowbrücke (1904), which together helped to relieve traffic in Schöneweide. However, the wooden bridge quickly deteriorated and, after only ten years, a new fixed crossing was urgently needed. The district administration opted for a steel bridge constructed of three arches of unequal length, which also had to accommodate the tracks of the industrial railroad leading to the Oberschöneweide factories. The new construction led to re-routing streetcar lines operated by the Berlin Ostbahnhof exclusively over the neighboring Treskow Bridge. The bridge plans were developed by Berlin civil engineer Karl Bernhard, who was also responsible for the superstructure. Preparatory work began in 1905, and the entire construction costs were covered by the municipality. Before the new Stubenrauch Bridge was built, there was only the Kaisersteg for pedestrians to cross the Spree and the later Treskow Bridge for vehicles, but the latter was a rather dilapidated wooden structure at the time. When the new bridge was inaugurated, it was named Stubenrauchbrücke in honor of the former Teltow district administrator, Ernst von Stubenrauch.	The Stubenrauch Bridge is a bridge over the Spree River in Oberschöneweide, Berlin. It was built in 1905 in honor of the former Teltow district administrator, Ernst von Stubanrauch. The bridge was built to accommodate the tracks of the industrial railroad.
" While awaiting trial, Snowden was housed in the Ada County jail. On September 28, 1956, Snowden asked for and received a court-appointed attorney. On October 5, 1956, he pleaded not guilty to the charges. However, on October 18, 1956, he changed his plea to guilty. After verifying that Snowden understood his guilty plea waived his right to a trial by jury and could lead to a life sentence or an execution, Judge M. Oliver Koelsch scheduled a hearing for October 23 to determine the degree of murder Snowden committed, as well as a punishment. The court ultimately determined that Snowden's crime was a first-degree murder and that there were no mitigating circumstances they could identify to justify reducing his punishment, so on October 26, Snowden was sentenced to death. His death sentence was initially scheduled to be carried out on December 7, 1956, but Snowden's lawyer filed a notice of appeal on his behalf, causing the initial execution date to be automatically delayed. In his appeal, Snowden argued that Dean's murder did not meet the criteria of a first-degree murder because he did not exhibit ""malice aforethought."" Snowden's attorney also requested a commutation of Snowden's sentence based on purported mental illness, as well as based on the argument that the crime more closely resembled second-degree murder or manslaughter, rather than first-degree murder, and that the death penalty was a disproportionately harsh punishment. In a unanimous opinion, the Idaho Supreme Court rejected Snowden's appeal. In September 1957, Judge Koelsch set Snowden's execution date for October 18, 1957."	The death sentence of Edward Snowden has been delayed by a judge in the Idaho Supreme Court in October 1956.

 What was initially reported as sewage was found to be about 1,000 US gallons (3,800 L; 830 imp gal) of a chemical mixture consisting of some sort of organic peroxide. In the first days of the investigation, officials speculated that two inert chemicals accidentally mixed in the truck and created an organic peroxide substance with sulfuric acid appearing to be part of the mix. Organic peroxide combines unstably bound oxygen together with hydrogen and carbon in the same molecule and ignites easily and then burns rapidly and intensely. While field testing was performed on the reactive material for initial identification, the county hazardous materials manager found that laboratories would not test the chemicals over concerns that lab personnel could be injured or their equipment damaged. Three weeks after the incident, the substance was still highly susceptible to friction and seemed to react to something as slight as wind. Sodium chlorite was identified in an internal investigation by the firm in the months following the disaster. They claimed that the chemical was being using as a water treatment agent for the first time and was stored in the same type of storage container as wastewater. The company said they treat about 100 different streams of waste. The owner of facility said that they never had a major problem such as this since the plant only takes non-hazardous waste. The worker combined the chemical with wastewater in the vacuum truck where the chemical interacting with organic material caused an explosion that blew off the back of the truck. A former county district attorney, retained by a company attorney, issued a report in March 2015 that provided an explanation of events indicating that the worker may have accidentally combined the chemicals. Later, investigators found that an inspection by a Defense Logistics Agency contractor was scheduled for that morning and officials of the firm had directed the transfer of these hazardous materials to another location.

 In 2006, a photo of an unidentified, large, monocarpic, fan palm in Madagascar was posted on PalmTalk, the society’s online forum. This photo led botanists to the site and to the discovery and description of a monotypic genus new to science, Tahina, which was published in 2008. The PalmTalk community subsequently spearheaded a drive to raise funds for its conservation. In 2020, the IPS launched its annual Save the Species campaign to raise awareness and funding for targeted palm conservation projects around the world. Save the Species target projects have included: 2020 Madagascar: Tahina spectabilis in partnership with Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. 2021 Colombia: Sabinaria magnifica in partnership with SalvaMontes. 2022 Hawaii: Pritchardia woodii in partnership with the National Tropical Botanic Garden. 2023 UK: Ravenea moorei in partnership with Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

 On the amavasya (new moon day) of the Hindu month of Ashadha, devotees observe Dashama vrat by installing a Sandhani made of soil in their home. Devotees also install a murti (icon) or image of the goddess Dashama with an icon of the Hindu god Ganesha. Devotees who observe this vrat wear the Kautuka (red-coloured thread) with 10 knots on their right hand on the first day and eat once a day (ek tanu). Daily, devotees perform puja (ritual worship), Aarti, reads the katha (legend) and then eats prasadi (food offering). Devotees also participate in Jagaran, a night vigil of prayer and worship. The vrat is observed for 10 days. On the last day, devotees observe the jagaran and around 4-5 AM, the murti is immersed into a water body like a river.	Hindus in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh are observing the Dashama vrat, which is a ritual of worship.
" The entire Dingle Glen area was highlighted as a proposed Natural Heritage Area in the Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council Development Plan of 2010–2016.

 Danny Budd is rejected by the Royal Marines due to his lack of height. An orphan, he lives with his sneering Uncle Fred and oafish cousin Ron in Northern town Tynecastle. Danny works as an underappreciated role as assistant to Fred's coal delivery business, and longs to be a Bootneck like his late father. After being spotted in a scuffle by a Marines recruiting officer, Danny is signed up. While his small stature makes him the butt of jokes his determination and courage soon shine through, especially when defending the barracks from a Luftwaffe raid. Despite further clashes with Fred, Ron and a brash company of Rangers deployed to the town he successfully completes training, and is deployed to the 1942 landings in North Africa. Danny is later selected for SBS missions in the Aegean Sea and fighting along partisans on Crete and in raids in Yugoslavia. Later his unit were selected to work with Soviet marines in the Black Sea, fighting in the Crimea over the winter of 1943. In 1944 he was assigned to special unit Striker Force for the Anzio landings; Danny was injured during the battle and sent on leave in Britain, ending up foiling an escape by German prisoners-of-war. He was later assigned to the Normandy landings force, coming ashore at Juno Beach. Danny fought in the Liberation of Paris and the push to Antwerp. Later in the year he was seconded to the United States Marine Corps, where he made fast friends with Moose Malloy, before being seriously injured fighting the Japanese in Burma in January 1945.

 The competition consisted of 80 teams: 48 championship division teams and 32 open division teams. Each of these divisions were further divided into two equal sized divisions for men and women. The championship division divided teams into eight groups of three teams each while the open division divided teams into four groups of four teams each, both engaging in a round-robin tournament that determined teams able to advance to a knockout stage. Pool play games were two 40-minute halves, separated by a seven-minute halftime and utilized the three points for a win system. After group stage play, the two highest ranked teams from each group advanced to their respective knockout stage. In the championship division, the third placed team advanced to a consolation bracket while in the open division, the third and fourth placed teams were eliminated. Knockout stage games also consisted of two 40-minute halves. The round of 16 and quarterfinals were separated by a seven-minute halftime while the semifinals and finals had a ten-minute halftime. Knockout stage games needed to declare a winner, therefore if a game was tied at the end of regulation, one 15-minute, golden-goal overtime period would begin. If still tied after overtime, kicks from the mark would determine the winner.	The finals of the Fifa Women's World Cup have taken place in Cardiff, County Durham, in the Isle of Man.
 In 1954, musician Ike Turner relocated his band the Kings of Rhythm from Clarksdale, Mississippi to St. Louis, Missouri. Turner performed around the greater St. Louis area and built a strong following. In 1957, Ann Bullock joined Turner's band as a vocalist and was called Little Ann. She was later given the stage name Tina Turner and they released their first song as Ike & Tina Turner in 1960. When the single became a hit, they began performing as the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. They embarked on a grueling series of one-nighters throughout the United States on the Chitlin' Circuit. They relocated to Los Angeles, California in 1962. In 1966, the Turners visited England for the first time to join the Rolling Stones on their British Tour. In 1969, they began headlining in Las Vegas, Nevada. They gained further exposure by performing at music festivals and joining the Rolling Stones for select dates on their American Tour. The revue continued to expand its audience by performing in Africa, Asia, and throughout Europe until they disbanded in 1976.	Tina Turner, who has died at the age of 74, was a singer-songwriter who rose to fame in the 1960s and 1970s.

 The Alvars (Tamil: ஆழ்வார், romanized: Āḻvār, lit. 'The Immersed') were the Tamil poet-saints of South India who espoused bhakti (devotion) to the Hindu deity Maha Vishnu, in their songs of longing, ecstasy, and service. They are venerated in Vaishnavism, which regards Vishnu as the Ultimate Reality. The devotional outpourings of the Alvars, composed during the early medieval period of Tamil history, were the catalysts behind the Bhakti Movement through their hymns of worship to Vishnu and his avatars. They praised the Divya Desams, the 108 divine realms of deities affiliated to Vaishnavism. The poetry of the Alvars echoes bhakti to God through love, and in the ecstasy of such devotions they sang hundreds of songs which embodied both depth of feeling and the felicity of expressions. The collection of their hymns is known as the Naalayira Divya Prabandham. The bhakti literature that sprang from Alvars has contributed to the establishment and sustenance of a culture that deviated from the Vedic religion and rooted itself in devotion as the only path for salvation. In addition, they contributed to Tamil devotional verses independent of a knowledge of Sanskrit.	The Alvars were a group of Tamil poet-saints who espoused bhakti (devotion) to the Hindu deity Maha Vishnu.
" Typically a skimmer draws water from the pool through a rectangular opening in the wall, at the top of the pool, connected through a device installed in one (or more) walls of the pool. The internal parts of the skimmer are accessed from the pool deck through a circular or rectangular cover, approximately one foot in diameter. If the pool's water pump is operational, it draws water from the pool through a hinged floating chute (which operates from a vertical position at a 90-degree angle to the pool, to prevent leaves and debris from being washed back into the pool by wave action), and down into a removable ""skimmer basket"", whose purpose is to catch leaves, dead insects and other larger floating debris. The opening visible from the side of the pool is usually 1'0"" (300 mm) wide by 6"" (150 mm) high, which cuts the water halfway down the center of the opening. Skimmers with wider openings are called ""wide angle"" skimmers and can be up to 2'0"" wide (600 mm). Floating skimmers have the advantage of not being affected by water level, as they adjust to work with the suction rate of the pump and will maintain optimal skimming regardless of water level, leading to a significantly reduced amount of biomaterial in the water. Skimmers should always have a leaf basket or filter between it and the pump to avoid clogging the pipes leading to the pump and filter."

 Innovation in a given language, most particularly in the prose of specialized subjects, does not normally occur in a vacuum; that is, so-called nonce-formations and compounding predominantly arise in more literary modes, such as epic poetry or drama (tragic or comic, etc.) rather than technical prose. Instead, novel technical terms are introduced most commonly as a result of language contact, e.g. the influence of a source language on a target language (Ancient Greek on Latin, German on English, etc.). This novelty is not always formal, e.g. neologisms or loan-words, but conceptual too, augmenting the existing meaning of words in the target language so as to accommodate or include new concepts introduced exogenously into the target language's lexicon. This phenomenon is an ancient one, proving to be decisive in the origins of Western Europe's philosophical and scientific vocabulary, for example. Many of the Ancient Greeks' original neologisms and novel meanings came to generate continual and permanent influence on Latin writers and, thence, on local languages across Europe in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.	In our series of letters from African journalists, academics and writers, we look at the ancient phenomenon of novelty.
 Immediately after the reveal of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater during a PlayStation Showcase in May 2022, Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 was announced for the PlayStation 5. It was originally revealed to contain Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. The games listing on the PlayStation Store later that day confirmed that the collection would also contain content from the Integral version of Metal Gear Solid, alongside the original MSX2 games Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. In June 2023, a Nintendo Direct revealed that the compilation was releasing for Nintendo Switch, the inclusion of Nintendo Entertainment System version of Metal Gear and its standalone sequel Snake's Revenge, and the Digital Graphic Novels for Solid and Solid 2. Releases for the Xbox Series X/S and Windows via Steam were confirmed later that day. Vol. 1 will release on October 24, 2023 alongside standalone version of the three Metal Gear Solid games for $19.99 each.

 The principle of the ethological halter seems to have been discovered by American Horse Whisperer Tom Dorrance. The American veterinarian Robert M. Miller believes that its use in the USA stems from the bosal hackamore of the Vaqueros, which has been adopted by almost all practitioners of natural horsemanship in the form of a rope halter with knots. According to Cynthia McFarland, American cowboys were the first to discover and make a rope halter. The use of this equipment spread from the United States to France in the early 2000s, as well as to Germany, accompanying the development of ethological equitation. French rider Michel Robert is a pioneer in the world of show jumping. Equestrian equipment manufacturers have adapted to demand. Many now offer this type of halter for sale, with a wide choice of models, colors and materials, and knots that can be placed in different ways. In the United States, the marketing of an ethological halter supposed to make horses softer, under the name of be-nice, has sparked debate.	A rope halter which could be used to make horses softer is being sold for sale in the US, according to experts.
" After the release of X&Y (2005), Coldplay decided to build their own recording studio. Chris Martin commented their former workplace ""felt a little dirty"" and the band ""weren't really speaking to each other. We all had our corner office in a big tower block, but there was no vibe"". Furthermore, they bought an old bakery in 2006 to help them refocus and established it as their headquarters. The building is intercalated between ""an estate agent and tiny restaurant"". Will Champion described it as a ""giant version"" of Jonny Buckland's room in Camden Road, from when the group studied at University College London. Producer Rik Simpson helped them to convert the place into a studio, which has their management offices above it and is ""good for overdubs"", but hard to do ""full band recordings""."	Coldplay's recording studio is in Camden, south London, where the band first recorded their first album in 2003, and where they first met producer Rik Simpson.
 Emperors Leopold I and Joseph I were striving to restore their rights in imperial Italy. A major point of contention regarded Parma and Piacenza, both of which were claimed by the Emperor and the Pope simultaneously. After the Siege of Turin during the War of the Spanish Succession, Joseph I strengthened his efforts to restore imperial rights in Italy. That the Pope had sided with the Bourbons against the Habsburgs also played a role in the conflict. In 1701, he had recognized Phillip of Anjou as the King of Spain. Concessions made by the Emperor to Lutherans in Silesia had also displeased the Pope. Papal territories had already been occupied by imperial forces in the campaigns of 1706 and 1707. In the territories considered to be part of the Empire, war taxes were levied. The Pope had retaliated with ecclesiastical penalties directed at imperial commanders and officials. Rinaldo d’Este, Duke of Modena, had sided with the Emperor, and his territories had suffered at the hands of French troops. He proceeded to claim the rule of the Duchy of Ferrara and the County of Comacchio. Both of these areas belonged to the Papal States. However, the Duke presented documents that stated the territories were really part of the Empire. His account of the matter was believed in Vienna. The Emperor allowed General Claude Alexandre de Bonneval to occupy Comacchio on May 24th, 1708. The imperial troops began to fortify the city and built a tower with an inscription meant to strengthen the imperial claim. These events triggered an open conflict. Behind the decision to escalate stood among others the Empress Wilhelmine Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg, who was also the sister of the Duchess of Modena. Another force behind the move was Charles Theodore, Prince of Salm. The Emperor himself approved the course of action, although Eugene of Savoy and others had advised against it. The goal was the Pope’s recognition of Archduke Charles as King of Spain and the expansion of imperial influence in Italy. A statement was released sharply criticizing the politics of the Pope. The Pope was accused of usurping feudal rights over Parma and Piacenza, supporting France, and punishing the imperial generals with unjust ecclesiastical rulings. This statement was interpreted by the papal court as a declaration of war.	Emperors Leopold I and Joseph I were striving to restore their rights in imperial Italy.

 North of Mbuamaji's old town (Currently called Gezaulole), on the seashore, is where the site is situated. A bulldozer has already damaged a portion of the site as of the early 2010s. There is a significant amount of both foreign and native cultural materials at the location. Dutch replicas of Chinese blue and white ceramics from the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as a Chinese blue and white potsherd, are examples of imported items. Other items include glass, red and white beads, Persian pottery, and red pottery from India that has black stripes painted on it. While some of the native pottery was painted in red or graphite, other pieces featured carved embellishments. The decorated ceramics are from the 12th–13th and 15th–16th centuries, respectively. A local potsherd was discovered to feature ornamental designs similar to those from Shungubweni and Pemba Mnazi. The abundance of both indigenous and imported cultural items sets the Mbuamaji site apart from all others north of Pemba Mnazi. Therefore, Mbuamaji ought to have been a very prosperous town. There is a rather modern mosque near the site with inscriptions from AH 1017 (1608 AD). Archaeologist Chittick's early research at the location reveals that the inscriptions were likely brought from another mosque because of the mosque's 19th-century Swahili architectural style. The inscriptions may be from an earlier mosque that once stood on the same spot, according to the updated dates for the location.	There is a large amount of native pottery and other items in the area . Some of the items have been painted in red and white . The inscriptions are from an earlier version of this article .

" El Velorio depicts a traditional 19th-century baquiné or velorio del angelito (""wake of a little angel""), a specific type of wake with origins in Afro-Puerto Rican culture that was celebrated by jibaros and other countrymen as funerary celebrations for the death of a child. This practice originates in the syncretic Catholic and folk belief that the death of an innocent baptized child results in their automatic ascension and entrance into Heaven and that the occasion is therefore a cause not only for remembrance but for celebration. The baquiné in this portrait depicts the deceased child as a focal point dressed in white and adorned with flowers, lying on a table at the center of a traditional countryside house. The iconography of the child, reminiscent of a Christ Child, symbolizes his purity and innocence but also presents a lighter theme that separates the painting into two visual contrasts: one lighter in colors that depicts scenes of joy and celebration with food and music, and another with darker colors and shadows that depicts not only the sorrow of the child's parents but also a chaotic scene of a priest trying to perform wake rites while dogs are running around. This exemplifies the everyday clash between life and death, and between celebration and suffering, common in the life of poor countrymen in 19th-century Puerto Rico. The scene is intentionally portrayed as a judgmental satire, with Francisco Oller himself describing the scene as “an orgy of brutish appetites under the guise of gross superstition."""	A painting by Puerto Rican artist Francisco Oller has gone on display at the National Museum of Puerto Rican Art in San Juan for the first time.
" It was established on 4 July 2022, with the purpose of expressing opposition to the French presence in Operation Barkhane, which the group perceives as a ""French military presence in Niger""; the group views it as a form of invasion. During these protests, participants used the flags of Russia and Niger as symbols. Protests continued as of 19 September 2022, and certain slogans emerged, such as ""France is a Nazi State! "", ""The colonial army (Barkhane) must leave"", and ""Pull the French colonial army out"". Many protesters also wore shirts depicting the Z symbol used during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The leader of M62, Abdoulaye Seydou, has denied any links with the Russian government, stating that ""We are fighting for Niger's sovereignty, so we are not with any foreign country partners"", and said protest organizers confiscated Russian flags brought by protesters.

Seydou was arrested by the government of Mohamed Bazoum just one day after the interview. During the 2023 Nigerien coup d'état against Bazoum, the group marched in support of the coup. In a march at the request of Abdourahmane Tchiani, thousands of pro-coup Nigeriens gathered in Niamey's Concertation Square, in front of the National Assembly, and went to the French embassy carrying Nigerien and Russian flags, with slogans such as ""Down with France, out with Barkhane, we don't care about ECOWAS, the European Union and the African Union! "", ""Arrest the former dignitaries to return the stolen millions"", and ""Down with France, long live Putin!"" The demonstrators also called for an immediate intervention by the Russian paramilitary Wagner Group. During the march, the entrances to the French and American embassies were closed.

 In July 2022, the conflict in Blue Nile State flared up in the Wad el-Mahi locality due to a land dispute that erupted between the Hausa on one side, and Berta and Funj on the other. The violence in July was partially triggered by these land conflicts and aggravated by political rivalries. This resurgence of violence follows an earlier outbreak in mid-July, where intercommunal clashes claimed numerous lives and forced thousands to flee to safer areas. The conflict's humanitarian impact has been severe, with approximately 235,000 individuals displaced and seeking refuge in makeshift shelters, including schools and nearby camps. The closure of markets due to the ongoing violence has left local residents struggling to meet their basic needs, while government offices remain shuttered.The clashes have led to protests across Sudan, particularly among the Hausa community, who are demanding justice for the victims. These protests have also shed light on issues of racism and marginalisation, as the Hausa community in Sudan, part of the Hausa ethnic group from West Africa, have been perceived as outsiders in Sudan. == References ==	Clashes between the Hausa and Funj ethnic groups in Sudan have left more than 200 people dead and forced thousands to flee their homes.

 On January 13, 1765, Van Eck, accompanied by Koopman and other officers, embarked on a journey from Colombo to rendezvous with an army stationed at Gonavila. Their route took them through Negombo and Tambaravila. Subsequent intelligence revealed that the Kandyans were bolstering their forces and fortifications, actively preparing for a potential invasion. Despite numerous challenges including widespread illnesses and frequent skirmishes, the Dutch army managed to persevere and eventually reached Kandy. Their journey led them through various locations, including Katugampola, Etambole, Visnave, Pidaravala, Kurunegala, Teliangona, and Vauda. Their final destination was the heavily fortified Galagedra fortress, which posed significant challenges to overcome. Nevertheless, after a day of concerted efforts, the fortress was successfully captured. The main army successfully crossed the Hoenay Oya on the morning of February 16. Upon reaching Katugastota along the banks of the Mahaweli River, they encountered another colonel who had already established a camp in the vicinity. Occupying the king's pleasure residence, they proceeded to plunder it. Subsequently, on February 19, they crossed the river. Arriving at the king's palace, they observed the king's absence. This led them to remain there for three days, during which they engaged in looting and plundering. Notably, substantial Kandyan forces emerged, bearing white flags as a sign of submission to the company. This event unfolded on February 22, and Van Eck, in response, conducted promotions for army officers and generals. The invasion proceeded with notable success, characterized by a lack of setbacks. Swiftly advancing and overcoming every Kandyan army they encountered, they demonstrated remarkable progress. In a parallel effort, another contingent led by Colonel Wesel, numbering 700 men, set out to dismantle the king's alternate palace. Upon receiving information that the king was residing there. Upon reaching the palace, it became evident that the king had fled again, the soldiers plundered and looted it again. As this group returned, they fell victim to an ambush, resulting in the unfortunate death of 48 soldiers on March 4. On the same day, Van Eck, along with fellow officers, journeyed back to Colombo. During their absence, Colonel Feber assumed responsibility for overseeing the occupation. Van Eck's return was met with a warm welcome and congratulations for the successful campaign. However, news soon arrived that the Kandyans had adopted guerrilla warfare tactics, launching an attack on a transport and a farm. Colonel Feber, who was in charge of the occupation, sought additional reinforcements in response to sporadic guerrilla warfare activities. Subsequently, following a significant engagement between Dutch forces and Kandyan insurgents on March 24th, reinforcements successfully entered occupied Kandy. During a battle while marching to Feber, Major Franken's troops emerged victorious against the Kandyan forces, compelling them to retreat to higher terrain. After a period of illness within the Dutch ranks and subsequent skirmishes with the Kandyan adversaries, diplomatic negotiations eventually led to the establishment of a peace agreement.

 The poem begins with Claudian recounting the career of Eutropius, an Eastern Roman politician and court eunuch, who became highly influential in the court of the empire who was highly influential in the Imperial court. Claudian claims that Eutropius spent his early years as a catamite, which was a type of prepubescent male companion in a pederastic relationship in ancient Rome. According to Claudian, Eutropius went on to become a pimp, and a lady's maid, before being freed of slavery out of disgust. Claudian then discusses his ascent to power, then describes his actions as a ruler, and portrays him as a cruel and corrupt ruler, then his campaign into Armenia, and then his rise to the position of consul. Claudian wrote that while the senate in Constantinople approved of his rise to consul, the rest of the Roman world found it to be distasteful. According to Claudian, the goddess Roma then begs the Western Emperor Honorius and his general Stilicho to prevent the same fate from occurring in the Western empire. Following this, due to their disgust at Eutropius, the god Mars and his sister Bellona incite the Greuthungi into revolt against Eutropius. After failing to bribe the rebels, Claudian describes Eutropius turning to his general Leo to end the revolt. Leo's expedition ends in a military disaster. Following this, the goddess Aurora goes to seek Stilicho, appealing to him to intervene and save the Eastern empire.	Claudian tells the story of Eutropius, an Eastern Roman politician and court eunuch. He claims that the senate in Constantinople approved of his rise to consul, but the rest of the Roman world found it distasteful.

 The NWA covers an area of 23.7 ha, including 1.46 ha in the marine environment. It is located five kilometers east of downtown Rimouski, and its territory lies entirely within the city of Rimouski, in the Pointe-au-Père sector.The Sainte-Anne River flows through the reserve from east to west. A large part of the reserve is a spartina marsh with several mudflats. The latter is protected from the St. Lawrence River by a rocky headland. The reserve's bedrock is part of the Trois-Pistoles formation. Much of the marsh is flooded during spring and autumn-spring tides. This Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician formation is composed of sandstone, conglomerate, siltstone and slate.	This invention relates to a marine environment reserve.
" The Ius in Memoria are akin to Ius in Bello, in focusing more on the ""how"" of commemoration. It has four criteria: Transcend the Collectives. Commemoration is seen as ethical if it encourages people to treat each other as individuals rather than group representatives. Exit Circular Narratives. Commemoration should help people exit narratives that trap them in debilitating interpretative loops. Assert Moral Autonomy. Groups should justify their actions in universal terms, rather than excusing transgressions with reference to what others have done. Contained Unfathomability. Good commemoration should be precise with dates, locations and names to tether past trauma. Numerical aspects of trauma should typically be communicated in broad categories. Proponents of the approach argue that taken together, the framework can constitute a comprehensive ethical approach or paradigm for commemoration. They concede that critiques of the just war tradition also apply to this moral framework, in that both pacifist and realist/revolutionary alternatives retain their validity."	The Ius in Memoria is an ethical framework for commemoration of past events, based on the work of the Roman Catholic Church's Ius Dei.
 Shortly after its establishment, the bubble economy collapsed, and it was affected by the Heisei recession and the lost decade that came after. After that, in addition to the recession, there were circumstances unique to the industry, such as construction work to support digital terrestrial broadcasting and a shift away from television. Many stations are small. Also, in the analog era, there were few relay stations Many broadcasting stations do not include all households in broadcast area. For this reason, in areas where direct reception is impossible, install a high-gain antenna in a higher position, rebroadcast cable TV, or even receive it at existing stations in surrounding prefectures. Even in the new Heisei station, there are special circumstances due to geographical relationships. Furthermore, for the above reasons, the scale of the company itself is small, and it tends to have weaker program production and sales capabilities than the TV and radio stations that have opened earlier. In addition, the stations that opened in the latter half of the 1990s were affected by the Heisei recession and were established in a smaller and more compact manner. Low number of employees Headquarters building is small or simple There are few branch offices and branch office networksand other features. As for ITV, for a while the master was placed at an affiliated station outside the prefecture. In contrast to the Nippon TV series (NNN/NNS) and TBS series (JNN), which have many starting stations, and the Fuji TV series (FNN/FNS), which expanded its network with the issuance of a large number of UHF station licenses, the TV Asahi series (ANN) network Expansion was delayed. For this reason, Heisei new stations have the most ANN member stations (out of 24 stations, 11 stations are ANN member stations). Of the 24 Fullnet stations, half joined the Heisei period. In addition, in contrast to the long-established stations led by local newspaper companies, most of the Heisei new stations' major shareholders have key stations and major affiliated stations in the top three. In addition, there are few other affiliated programs on the net, and the proportion of in-house produced programs is also small. Although the number is small, there are newspaper companies that are closely related to the Heisei Shinkyoku (Hokkoku Shimbun, Nagasaki Shimbun, Okinawa Times, etc.). Most of the Heisei new stations have not listed.	In areas where direct reception is impossible, install a high-gain antenna in a higher position, rebroadcast cable TV, or even receive it at existing stations in surrounding prefectures.

" Addressing feudalism would necessitate a distinct kind of association with England. Historically, the fidelity of the local lords played a pivotal role in the Channel Islands' choice to remain under the English monarch. Central to this intricate relationship is the practice and importance of fiefs, deeply ingrained in Norman tradition. In Normandy, and subsequently in the Channel Islands, fiefs were deemed of utmost significance, as eloquently described in the Coutume de Normandie (the legal customs of Normandy): ""Je ne sais pas quelles sont ces dignités qui peuvent être possédés sans fond ni glebe, et pour lesquelles on doit hommage et non relief, à la réserve de certaines sargenteries qui n'ont point de glebe. Ces fiefs en l'air sont fiefs impropres; proprie enim feudum in rebus soli constitit.""transl. ""I do not know what these dignities are that can be held without foundation or glebe, and for which homage is due and not relief, except for certain sargenteries that have no glebe. These floating fiefs are improper fiefs; for a proper fief rests on tangible assets."" The Coutume elucidates the divergence between Norman and English practices: ""(en Normandie) on n'en use pas comme en Angleterre, où les dignités des Ducs & Comtes ne sont pas attachées aux fiefs. Ce sont des dignités personnelles que le ROI donne à qui lui plaît, et tel s'appelle Duc & comte de Warwick, de Northumberland... mais même n'y a rien du tout.""transl. ""(In Normandy) they do not operate as they do in England, where the titles of Dukes & Counts aren't tethered to fiefs. These are personal titles bestowed by the KING at his discretion, and someone might be named Duke & Count of Warwick, Northumberland... yet they don't hold any tangible property."" This distinction rests upon the inherent value placed on possessing glebe (landed estates) in the Channel Islands. While firmly rooted in Norman traditions, it contrasts sharply with the English approach. The Channel Islands' feudal tradition is commonly recognized as one of the unique characteristics that distinguish the islands and grants them a special status. As C. Northcote Parkinson once remarked: ""Without its feudalism, Guernsey as a tourist resort would be little different from Bognor Regis."""

 The sculpture consist of two sphinxes, with the left missing its head. Found in fragments initially, the stele was broken from side to side, along with the forelegs, which were subsequently repaired. The lower portion is decorated with a frieze of palmettes, egg, and dart, characteristic of 5th century BC style, with portions of the stele maintaining its original polychromy with red-brown pigment. Both sphinxes are faced back to back, gazing out in three-quarters perspective. The intact sphinx has its hair intact and long, pulled back on the sides, but covering her ears, and wears a crown consisting of circles and merlons, the back of the stele is roughed out with its bottom half broken off. The sphinx motif on the stele indicates it's prominence in cult objects, as prior to the stele's approximate creation, in the mid 5th century BC, the depiction was also seen in the Amathus sarcophagus, considered the most significant object in the Cesnola collection alongside the stele, famous for its preserved polychromy. == References ==	A polychromy preserved sphinx with a frieze of palmettes, egg, and dart, with portions of the stele maintaining its original polychromy with red-brown pigment.
 Informateur Wim van der Grinten explored the possibility of bringing together PvdA, CDA and D'66 without success. The former KVP state secretary was appointed on the recommendation of Van Agt to 'investigate the possibilities of forming a cabinet in the shortest possible time that can be confident of receiving sufficient support from the parliament'. Van der Grinten tried to force a breakthrough with various compromises, but together with the negotiators he concluded that the 'implementation problem' was unsolvable. Van der Grinten then investigated whether PvdA wanted to work with VVD, but Van Thijn rejected this. The discussions between CDA and VVD subsequently led to an agreement within a week. The conversations between Van Agt and Wiegel started on 14 November. On Wiegel's recommendation, they decided to strive to keep it short and concise. Wiegel's proposal to keep the outside world - including their factions - out was also adopted. Even council advisor Herman Tjeenk Willink and director of the Government Information Service Gijs van der Wiel, who had always been there until then, were sent away. Already in the first conversation they managed to make agreements about the WIR, the VAD, the works councils and the distribution of ministerial posts. Parts of the agreement with PvdA and D'66 were adopted, such as the abortion paragraph. What helped was the good atmosphere between the party leaders, in contrast to the conversations between Van Agt with Van Thijn and Den Uyl. The draft agreement was sent to the factions on 22 November. The VVD quickly agreed, but under pressure from ARP members such as Aantjes and Scholten, dozens of amendments were submitted. Wiegel responded with understanding and an amended agreement was reached on 26 November. The VVD faction unanimously agreed to the result on 28 November. An extensive consultation took place at the CDA, which continued until the early morning. The majority voted in favor, but six faction members — Aantjes, Hans de Boer, Beumer, Van Houwelingen, Scholten (all from ARP) and Dijkman (KVP) — voted against. They indicated that they tolerated the cabinet and were known as the CDA loyalists. During a faction meeting on 5 December Willem de Kwaadsteniet also joined this group. Because of this tolerating support, there was some commotion, because Van der Grinten's assignment was to create a parliamentary majority cabinet. PvdA objected to this, but this had no effect. On 2 December the parties reached an agreement in principle on the distribution of ministerial posts. Van Agt was the intended prime minister, after Jelle Zijlstra, Pierre Lardinois, Jan van den Brink and Roelof Nelissen had resigned. Wiegel was intended as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior. Van der Grinten submitted his final report on 6 December.	Dutch Prime Minister Frederic van Agt has failed to reach an agreement with opposition parties in the wake of his resignation.
 One of the former shaft buildings had been converted into a casino and ballroom; it was demolished in the 1980s due to its dilapidated state. After the closure of the coalfields, the stables opposite the old shaft were bought by a private owner before being destroyed by fire. The ruins remained until they were demolished on May 31, 2006. At the beginning of the 21st century, no trace of the installations remained (apart from the ruins of a small outbuilding) and the shaft was located under a pavilion at the foot of a hill. In September 2012, a commemorative monument to early mining was built near the old shaft. It is made up of two minecarts and a wood framing.	The ruins of a mine shaft in the Cumbrian coalfield were discovered in the 1970s by a member of the public who was walking his dog.

 The drying mechanisms used in drying rooms can be classified according to: Drying medium: Hot air, smoke, inert gas, superheated steam Operating pressure: Atmospheric pressure, constant pressure, pulsating pressure, vacuum drying, positive pressure drying Method of heat transfer: Conventional convection (indirect), contact drying (direct), ultrasonic, microwave, infrared, ultraviolet, dielectric or electric resistance drying. Desiccant flow method: What is being dried stands still or has occasional movements (for example, a clothes horse) The source of movement is the motion of what is being dried (tumble-dryer) The source of movement of the dried material is mainly the kinetic energy of the drying medium Mechanical transport, i.e., that the dried material is moved mechanically Linear motion (belt, rollers, chain, screw, vibration, rake dryer) Rotational movement (tumble dryer) Frequency: Periodic drying or continuous drying Installation method: Fixed or mobile	A drying room is a place where dried material can be dried in a variety of ways, depending on the drying medium and the source of heat transfer.
" After the general elections of November 2019 and the start of the 14th legislature, acting Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez (PSOE) required the abstention of the leading political parties of the nationalist left, the Catalan ERC and Basque EH Bildu, in order to form his second government during the January 2020 parliamentary session. This gesture, among other minor arrangements with EH Bildu, was a central element of criticism by the Spanish political right (mainly the People's Party and Vox). Francisco Javier García Gaztelu, nicknamed ""Txapote"", was one of the main leaders of the Basque terrorist group ETA. He has been in prison since 2005 after being accused of committing more than a dozen murders, including those of Miguel Ángel Blanco, Gregorio Ordóñez, and Fernando Buesa."	Spain's political parties have voted in favour of forming a new government in the wake of the arrest of one of its most senior politicians.
 In July 2022, the conflict in Blue Nile State flared up in the Wad el-Mahi locality due to a land dispute that erupted between the Hausa on one side, and Berta and Funj on the other. The violence in July was partially triggered by these land conflicts and aggravated by political rivalries. This resurgence of violence follows an earlier outbreak in mid-July, where intercommunal clashes claimed numerous lives and forced thousands to flee to safer areas. The conflict's humanitarian impact has been severe, with approximately 235,000 individuals displaced and seeking refuge in makeshift shelters, including schools and nearby camps. The closure of markets due to the ongoing violence has left local residents struggling to meet their basic needs, while government offices remain shuttered.The clashes have led to protests across Sudan, particularly among the Hausa community, who are demanding justice for the victims. These protests have also shed light on issues of racism and marginalisation, as the Hausa community in Sudan, part of the Hausa ethnic group from West Africa, have been perceived as outsiders in Sudan. == References ==	In our series of letters from African journalists, Zeinab Mohammed Salih looks at how violence in Blue Nile State in Sudan has changed since the end of the year.
 At his death, Lat Sukaabe left Cayor to a son by an Ayor wife and Baol to a son by a Baol-Baol wife. Without his leadership, conflict between the two sister kingdoms immediately resumed. The French, having learned how inconvenient it could be to have Cayor and Baol united, continually interfered to keep them apart. The constant wars between them provided both a consistent supply of slaves and a ready market for European weaponry. : 85 Lat Sukaabe ensured the dominance of the Gej matrilineage for much of the next two centuries, supplanting the Dorobe and Gelwaar.

 After the period of Arab rule in Armenia and the South Caucasus, a new period of cultural flourishing began, and active church building was accompanied by new sculptural compositions and solutions. The “first signs” were khachkars (crossstones), which partially continued the tradition of four-sided stelae, forming an original compositional and iconographic system. The period of great and small kingdoms in Armenia, the 9th-11th centuries, was characterized by the formation of several large cultural centers and artistic styles: in Shirak (Shirakavan, Argina, Kars, Ani), Tayk (Ishkhan, Banak, Chordvan, Khakhu), Vaspurakan (Aghtamar), Syunik (Tatev, Bgheno-Noravank). In 915-921 by the order of Gagik Artsruni, the Armenian king of Vaspurakan, one of the unique Armenian monuments, the Church of the Holy Cross on the Aghtamar island was built. The peculiarity of the building was the modest size of the church, the facades of which the architect Manuel managed to decorate with an unprecedented number of sculptures and extensive scenes. The animal types in reliefs are also unprecedented, including fabulous ones. Alternating each other uninterrupted rows of scenes and images of the Aghtamar church seem to be the visual embodiments of the Holy Bible. The monumental images of King Gagik and the deified ancestors of the Artsruni family also found their place in this “Heavenly World”. The 9th-11th centuries Armenian sculpture is rich in images of patrons. On the tympanum of the main entrance of the church of Yerznka (near Ani) (895) were depicted two princes on horseback before the Virgin and Child and accompanied by angels (destroid). In the second half of the 10th century, the high relief figures of the crowned princes Gurgen and Smbat Bagratuni were depicted on the eastern facades of the main churches of Sanahin and Haghpat monasteries (St. Amenaprkich church 966, St. Nshan church 976). And the representatives of the younger branch of Bagratuni (in Tayk), Bagrat and David, were solemnly depicted in Oshkvank (963-973). The compositions of Aghtamar and Oshkvank had direct iconographic correlation to Byzantine imperial images (the mosaic of Constantine and Justinian, St. Sophia, end of the 10th century). And the almost round sculpture of Smbat Bagratuni in Haghpat got its further development in the two-meter statue of King Gagik of Ani, which once decorated the façade of the church of St. Grigor- Gagkashen (1001-1020, architect Trdat). A group of frontal sculptural faces are pre-their unique decorations. That composition consisted of blind arcades extending along the facades of the church and a sculptured “belt” of the Heavenly Garden inhabited by birds, animals, and sometimes with human figures.	The Armenian church of the Holy Cross on the Aghtamar island in the Caspian Sea is one of the world’s oldest churches, built in the 9th and 10th centuries.
" The story was one of several Crisis stories to be rapidly repackaged as a graphic novel, an unusual step for British comics of the time. Rian Hughes, art director for Crisis, handled the design, which included a new cover commissioned from Pleece and a foreword by Grant Morrison. At this stage the story began attracting negative attention from Christian groups, and The Sunday Times ran an interview with Dave Roberts (then-editor of Christian magazine Alpha), describing it as ""an incitement to religious hatred"" and comparing it to Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses as an example of blasphemy. Fleetway's managing director John Davidge, who had controversially blocked Crisis from publishing Peter Milligan and Brendan McCarthy's ""Skin"", ordered the collected edition withdrawn after a short period on sale; a press release stated this was due to the story being ""inappropriate"" for the book market. Purportedly Davidge made the decision on the direct order of Fleetway owner Robert Maxwell. The print run - variously reported as being 5,000 or 20,000 copies - was destroyed. The Economist ran an article on the controversy on 19 January 1991, speculating that ""no one would think twice about it"" if the story was a novel, and felt that the furore was largely caused by the ongoing belief in the press that the comic medium was still exclusively aimed at children. New Statesman also discussed the controversy, quoting a BBC Radio 4 interview where Ennis reiterated his opposition to organised religion. In 1997 DC's mature readers Vertigo Comics label, for whom Ennis was writing Preacher at the time, released a new collected edition with a fresh cover by Pleece and a ne foreword by Ennis himself."	"""The Devil in the White City"" was one of the most controversial stories in British comic book history, and was withdrawn from print in 1991 by publisher Fleetway."
 Currently, the Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo forest is a large natural area and one of the largest recreational areas in the North West of Moscow along with Serebryany Bor. A linden park is on the north side of the manor house. Some very old trees have also been preserved there. The park has a variety of tree types, including pines, maples, larches, lindens, oaks, birchs, elms, cedars, spruces, and apple trees. Many local residents frequently visit the ponds located in the eastern part of the park. There is a beach area around a large pond, with some trees. The northern and northwestern parts of the park were created relatively recently where a mixed forest originally was. The layout has a system of paths. The northwestern natural boundary of the park is the Khimka River, the only clean source of drinking water in Moscow as of 2009. The spring has several water pipes, where residents of neighboring and remote areas can collect clean drinking water. The spring had a mosaic panel depicting a swan princess that was destroyed after updates were made to the spring.	The Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo forest was originally a manor house built in the early 19th Century in Moscow, Russia.
 The Dunstan Mountains form the entrance to the Upper Clutha Valley. The northwest flank of the range is bound by a combination of Cluden Stream in the Lindis Valley, the Lindis River, the Clutha River (Māori: Mata-Au) and Lake Dunstan. Lake Dunstan follows the former Clutha River through the Cromwell Gorge demarcating the southwest limit of the mountains. The mountain range is bound to the east by the Manuherikia Valley and to the northeast by Dunstan Creek, which joins the Manuherikia River at Saint Bathans. The Dunstan Mountains are bisected by the 4-wheel drive Thomson Gorge Road which follows Thomsons Creek, incised into the eastern flank of the range and the Rise and Shine Creek on the western flank. Thomsons Saddle, between the two creeks, climbs to 980 m (3,220 ft) elevation. The summit landscape is generally a broad, gently sloping undulatory surface which climbs steadily from the west and falls sharply to the Manuherakia Valley floor on the east. The asymmetric nature of the Dunstan Mountains is common with most of Central Otago's basin and range mountains.

" For a very long time, historians could not trace the ancestry of Vijayalaya Chola, who is considered to be the founder of Medieval Chola dynasty, historians and epigraphists in the wake of Eastern Chalukya king's Copper plate grants, Anbil plates of Parantaka Chola II and Velanjeri plates of Parantaka Chola I believe that Vijayalaya chola might well belong to the Telugu Cholas lineage, who themselves trace their ancestry to the ancient Tamil King, Karikala Chola. Vijayalaya Chola's predecessor is Srikantha Choladhiraja according to Anbil plates of Parantaka Chola II. After mentioning Kochchenganan and his son Nalladikon, Anbil plates has the following verse, ""Srikantha-graha [na]rudha kumkumamka-bhujantarah Srikantha iti-rajendras tat-kuli sam-ajayata"" The above line translates to: In his family was born the chief of kings called Sri Kantha on whose chest were impressed marks of saffron from Lakshmi (Sri)'s embracing his neck. It will be evident from this that Srikantha was not the immediate successor of Nalladikon, but was a descendant of his, born in the family long after. The next verse introduces Vijayalaya Chola, the founder of Imperial Cholas."	In our series of letters from African journalists, historians and epigraphists examine the ancestry of Vijayalaya chola.
 The two franchises first met in the 2004 NBA playoffs, when Indiana won 4–2 in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Indiana was seen as title contenders, having the 1st seed in the Eastern Conference, and the best record in the league, led by Reggie Miller, Jermaine O'Neal, Ron Artest, and Al Harrington. The Heat were led by rookie Dwyane Wade, Lamar Odom, Eddie Jones, and Caron Butler, with this being Wade's first ever playoff experience. The Pacers would go on to lose in 6 games in the Eastern Conference Finals to the eventual 2004 NBA Champion Detroit Pistons.

 In 2006, a photo of an unidentified, large, monocarpic, fan palm in Madagascar was posted on PalmTalk, the society’s online forum. This photo led botanists to the site and to the discovery and description of a monotypic genus new to science, Tahina, which was published in 2008. The PalmTalk community subsequently spearheaded a drive to raise funds for its conservation. In 2020, the IPS launched its annual Save the Species campaign to raise awareness and funding for targeted palm conservation projects around the world. Save the Species target projects have included: 2020 Madagascar: Tahina spectabilis in partnership with Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. 2021 Colombia: Sabinaria magnifica in partnership with SalvaMontes. 2022 Hawaii: Pritchardia woodii in partnership with the National Tropical Botanic Garden. 2023 UK: Ravenea moorei in partnership with Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

 Belarusian Hajun was created in early January 2022 as a monitoring initiative to track movements of Russian military equipment and troops on the territory of Belarus. The project had the task of monitoring the amount of equipment transported into the country and withdrawn, and where a new Russian military base could potentially emerge. The project was created so that Belarusians would understand what was happening on the territory of Belarus. On February 20, 2022, the Telegram channel of Hajun was created, in which the team began publishing information about detected Russian troops and their movements. For the first two months of the war, the team had to work 24/7. In February and March, an average of 1500 people a day wrote to the project. At the peak, this figure reached up to 2000 people. In March 2022, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus recognized the project's Telegram channel as an extremist formation. In April 2022, more than 360 thousand people subscribed to the channel. At that time, 90% were subscribers from Ukraine, and the rest were Belarusians. As of February 25, 2023, more than half a million people were subscribed to the project's Telegram channel.	Belarusian Hajun, a Telegram channel set up during the war between Russia and Ukraine in 2022, has been shut down by the Belarusian government.
 Currently, the Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo forest is a large natural area and one of the largest recreational areas in the North West of Moscow along with Serebryany Bor. A linden park is on the north side of the manor house. Some very old trees have also been preserved there. The park has a variety of tree types, including pines, maples, larches, lindens, oaks, birchs, elms, cedars, spruces, and apple trees. Many local residents frequently visit the ponds located in the eastern part of the park. There is a beach area around a large pond, with some trees. The northern and northwestern parts of the park were created relatively recently where a mixed forest originally was. The layout has a system of paths. The northwestern natural boundary of the park is the Khimka River, the only clean source of drinking water in Moscow as of 2009. The spring has several water pipes, where residents of neighboring and remote areas can collect clean drinking water. The spring had a mosaic panel depicting a swan princess that was destroyed after updates were made to the spring.	Moscow's Pokrovkovsky-Streshnevo forest is one of the most famous parks in the Russian capital, according to the Kremlin.
 Dūr-Abī-ešuḫ is attested to have been occupied during the reigns of four contiguous rulers of Babylon, Abi-Eshuh, Ammi-Ditana, Ammi-Saduqa and Samsu-Ditana. This period marked the slow decline of the Old Babylonian Empire from the glory days of Hammurabi and the early rise of the First Sealand Dynasty beginning under its first ruler Ilī-ma-AN. Under ruler Samsu-iluna, predecessor of Abi-Eshuh, Babylon lost effective control over Nippur to Ilī-ma-AN and Sealand. Abi-Eshuh fortified the southern region of the Babylonian empire and dammed the Tigris river and as a result full control of Nippur had been regained by his 5th year. It is known that on or about year 11 of the reign of Ammi-Ditana, successor in Babylon to Abi-Eshuh, the major city of Nippur came under attack and was again partially abandoned. Dūr-Abī-ešuḫ was pivotal in the defense of Nippur.

" Typically a skimmer draws water from the pool through a rectangular opening in the wall, at the top of the pool, connected through a device installed in one (or more) walls of the pool. The internal parts of the skimmer are accessed from the pool deck through a circular or rectangular cover, approximately one foot in diameter. If the pool's water pump is operational, it draws water from the pool through a hinged floating chute (which operates from a vertical position at a 90-degree angle to the pool, to prevent leaves and debris from being washed back into the pool by wave action), and down into a removable ""skimmer basket"", whose purpose is to catch leaves, dead insects and other larger floating debris. The opening visible from the side of the pool is usually 1'0"" (300 mm) wide by 6"" (150 mm) high, which cuts the water halfway down the center of the opening. Skimmers with wider openings are called ""wide angle"" skimmers and can be up to 2'0"" wide (600 mm). Floating skimmers have the advantage of not being affected by water level, as they adjust to work with the suction rate of the pump and will maintain optimal skimming regardless of water level, leading to a significantly reduced amount of biomaterial in the water. Skimmers should always have a leaf basket or filter between it and the pump to avoid clogging the pipes leading to the pump and filter."

 The result was Selangor's biggest league victory in 87 years. Kelantan has now broken the Malaysian football record with recorded 106 goals conceded in all competitions this season including a record breaking 87 goals conceded in the Super League. On previous results they also lost with a big score to Terengganu with a result of 8–0 in the league match and also Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT) with a result of 10–0 in the cup match. Kelantan head coach Angel Alfredo Vera said that the lack of imported players in his squad was one of the reasons for the team’s crushing big loss defeat to Selangor in their Super League match. He shrugged off the result saying, “We didn’t have players who could dominate this match, especially imported players. The players we have are very young, they don’t have the experience, on average they have only played five Super League matches,” he told the post-match press conference. The outcome was also the worst loss by a home team in Malaysian football history, as the eleventh-goal difference doubled the previous record margin. == References ==	Kelantan have now broken the Malaysian football record with 106 goals conceded in all competitions this season .

 Entering service on 22 April 1985 on the Bluemull Sound service, taking over from the original MV Geira, which was then sold out of the fleet. She operated alone on the Gutcher, Yell - Belmont, Unst - Oddsta, Fetlar service until 1988 when she was joined by MV Fylga. Once the two new Yell ferries were introduced in 2004, MV Bigga replaced Fylga on the service. This is the same year that the Fetlar terminal changed from Oddsta to Hamars Ness. Due to a vessel change, on 3 October 2005, Fivla was relegated to the fleet relief vessel, which she still operates as today. Each month she covers a different ro-ro ferry in the fleet so that they can go for their annual refit. She also covers any breakdowns that occur across the fleet. The only rest the ferry gets is when she goes for her own annual refit, normally on the Malakoff slip in Lerwick. On 28 April 2010, while carrying out refit cover in Yell Sound, she was trapped underneath the linkspan in Toft. This was due to four preventer chains on the linkspan snapping simultaneously from the low spring tides and the lower freeboard of the relief vessel. Due to this, during the following days (29 April and 4 May 2010), she operated a special service between Vidlin and Ulsta, Yell. == References ==	Fivla entered service on 22 April 1985 on the Bluemull Sound service, taking over from the original MV Geira.

" In traditional Chinese medicine, several medicinal teas incorporate cash coins as ingredients. This usage of cash coins has been documented as early as the Eastern Jin dynasty, in China's first emergency medicine manual, Zhou hou fang (肘後方).Brass cash coins would first be thoroughly washed before their usage in this process and then boiled in water to produce a type of ""tea"" which was later consumed by the patient. Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine believe that the zinc present in cash coins, which had been leached into the slightly acidic liquid, are said to supposedly promote both healing and the enhancement of the immune system. Meanwhile, bronze cash coins which typically have high concentrations of lead and tin (which in traditional Chinese medicine are said to have the same ""medicinal properties"" as the element mercury), were typically boiled to produce a solution used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of the auris externa. Vietnamese cash coins, which have the highest levels of zinc of any cash coins, were ground up into a powder that was mixed into an aqueous solution or a type of ointment for the treatment of the eyes, ears, and hemorrhoids, or for more topical uses."	Cash coins have been used to treat the auris externa, according to a new study published in China's National Journal of Emergency Medicine.

 The minority stress model takes into account significant stressors that distinctly affect the mental health of those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or another non-conforming gender identity. Some risk factors that contribute to declining mental health are heteronormativity, discrimination, harassment, rejection (e.g., family rejection and social exclusion), stigma, prejudice, denial of civil and human rights, lack of access to mental health resources, lack of access to gender-affirming spaces (e.g., gender-appropriate facilities), and internalized homophobia. The structural circumstance where a non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming individual is embedded in significantly affects the potential sources of risk. The compounding of these everyday stressors increase poor mental health outcomes among individuals in the LGBT community. Evidence shows that there is a direct association between LGBT individuals' development of severe mental illnesses and the exposure to discrimination.In addition, there are a lack of access to mental health resources specific to LGBT individuals and a lack of awareness about mental health conditions within the LGBT community that restricts patients from seeking help.	A minority stress model has been developed to assess the mental health of members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community.
 A 110 km (68 mi) track from Koderma to Maheshmunda was constructed. This extended the Madhupur–Giridih railway line to Koderma, effectively making it a Madhupur–Giridih–Koderma line.

Eastern Railway has announced a new railway line between Madhupur and Maheshmunda in the southern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
 The drying mechanisms used in drying rooms can be classified according to: Drying medium: Hot air, smoke, inert gas, superheated steam Operating pressure: Atmospheric pressure, constant pressure, pulsating pressure, vacuum drying, positive pressure drying Method of heat transfer: Conventional convection (indirect), contact drying (direct), ultrasonic, microwave, infrared, ultraviolet, dielectric or electric resistance drying. Desiccant flow method: What is being dried stands still or has occasional movements (for example, a clothes horse) The source of movement is the motion of what is being dried (tumble-dryer) The source of movement of the dried material is mainly the kinetic energy of the drying medium Mechanical transport, i.e., that the dried material is moved mechanically Linear motion (belt, rollers, chain, screw, vibration, rake dryer) Rotational movement (tumble dryer) Frequency: Periodic drying or continuous drying Installation method: Fixed or mobile	A tumble-dryer is described which uses the kinetic energy of the material being dried to move the material being dried.
 The model of the Chinese Mongolian is the same as that of the Mongolian horse. It is considered locally as a horse because of this model and not as a pony. The head has a rectilinear profile and is rather heavy, with a broad forehead, open nostrils, protruding eyes, and long ears. The neck is short and muscular, the chest deep, the shoulder fairly sloping and muscular. The withers are not very prominent; the back is short, solid, and straight. The croup is long and sloping. The legs are short, strong, and solid. The breed is renowned for its solid constitution. The average height is 1.28 m, 1.27 m for mares, and 1.30 m for males. Weight ranges from 300 to 360 kg, with an average of 360 for males and 300 for females. There are variations according to type. For example, the University of Oklahoma study, dating from 2007, gives a size range from 1.21 to 1.42 m, and CAB International, in its study published in 2016, 1.22 to 1.42 m. Size increases markedly when environmental conditions are favorable.	The model of the Chinese Mongolian is the same as that of the Mongolian horse .

 In 2016, Garcia founded the party called Prodinculous/Procitizen advocating for the protection of entrepreneurial freedom and the preservation of individuals' rights to private ownership. Garcias has voiced his belief as the surveys indicate that Venezuelans are in favor of Free Enterprise, economic freedom, dialogue, and women's rights. He was disqualified from running for the mayor of Caracas, a decision he publicly denounced. In 2019, he traveled to the United States and met with Mauriceo Clever and various officials in the Donald Trump administration. During this time, he emphasized the need for a unity government between the opposition and the Chavista government as the solution for Venezuela's political problems. Ten deputies who were previously members of the parliamentary block of the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) in the National Assembly (AN) from Un Nuevo Tiempo and other parties resigned from their parties and joined García's political movement. Garcia announced that his party would field a candidate in the 2024 Venezuelan presidential election.	The former deputy mayor of Caracas, Carlos Garcia, has announced he will stand in the 2024 Venezuelan presidential election.
 Players of John Company will consider some of the issues that affected the historical EIC between 1710 and the 1860s. For instance, players must decide whether or not to try and conquer the Indian kingdoms; if they do, they may install a Governor-General, and traffic the opium they control to China. Players may hire Indians to assist them; these include Sikhs, the Jagat Seth family, Awadh, Arcot, Orissa, the Nizam of Hyderabad, and a Rajput prince. Meanwhile, Indians may revolt against the Company; in the real world, this led to the EIC's downfall, due to the Indian Revolt of 1857. The exact setup rules depend on the scenario the players choose, reflecting the historical fortunes of India and the EIC. For the 1710 or long 1710 scenarios, the Company has no debt, weak armies, and no ships. If the game starts in 1758, the Calico Acts will already have been passed, there is a governor in Bengal, the Company is already in debt, and Mysore and Bombay are stronger than in 1710. For an 1813 scenario, the Company has larger armies and more ships, while Bombay is weaker but the Punjab stronger. The laws players consider voting on also reflect historical fact. One card in the deck represents the Calico Acts; historically, these banned imports of cotton (as the EIC had been doing) and helped the rise and industrialization of the British cotton industry. If passed, the game card simulates this by reducing Company profits and allowing players to buy extra workshops while rewarding those who already have them; it also has support in Parliament, which reflects how MPs represented local economies dependent on textiles, while the rents of many Lords were connected to the wool industry. The Writer Privileges law, on the other hand, has less support in Parliament, but allows the players to gain extra money from trading in India, and makes future votes to deregulate the Company easier; a historical note on the card explains that reducing restrictions led to cheaper prices for Indian goods in Britain, which led to more support for deregulation. Players may also debate whether to recruit sepoys (Indian soldiers), extend the franchise (reducing the value of rotten boroughs and making it more expensive to buy votes), or provide relief for famines in India. These reflect issues Britain and the EIC faced in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the Reform Act 1832, Chartism, and several famines which affected India. One of the game's topics is the relationship between the EIC's actions in India and British culture then and now, and how reliant Britain was on its empire. For example, if the Company is successful, players will have more money and votes with which to influence Parliament; but whether it is or not, its violent actions will inevitably affect on its own culture.

For the 1710 or long 1710 scenarios, the Company has no debt, weak armies, and no ships. If the game starts in 1758, the Calico Acts will already have been passed, and the Company is already in debt.
 The AN/PSQ-42 Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular combines two image intensification tubes with an uncooled thermal imager and is able to operate in an I²-only mode or a fusion mode that combines I² with a thermal image overlay. The overlay is also capable of displaying a compass and augmented reality data from a Nett Warrior device. The ENVG-B can also display wirelessly transmitted weapon sight crosshair and thermal imagery from the Family of Weapon Sights-Individual (FWS-I) thermal imager mounted on a weapon. The image-intensifying tubes also allows the user to illuminate, designate, and engage targets conventionally with weapon-mounted infrared laser pointer-illuminator devices such as the AN/PEQ-15. The entire ENVG-B assembly consists of the ENVG-B goggles themselves, Positioning Assembly (PA), Helmet Mount Assembly (HMA) and battery pack. In a fashion similar to the AN/PSQ-20 and AN/PVS-31, the ENVG-B does not receive power from a battery within the goggle housing itself (such as in the AN/PVS-14). Instead, the goggle receives power from the battery pack mounted on the rear of the soldier's helmet via a circuit that traverses the HMA and PA, with hotshoe connectors at the interface between those components. This shifts the center mass of an ENVG-B equipped helmet toward the wearer's neck, resulting in a more ergonomic balance and reducing neck strain, especially in the prone. The ENVG-G assembly can be mounted on the ACH, ECH and IHPS helmets. A special helmet cover designed to conceal the battery pack and HMA exists for the ACH and ECH. A small infrared illuminator is built into the housing for viewing handheld items like a map, weapon, or radio. A gain control knob is centrally mounted on the bridge of the goggle housing. Both the eyepieces and objective lenses are capable of affixing a protective sacrificial lens, and the objective lenses have removable protective rubber caps with lanyards.

 The slogan of The Farmlink Project is “Fighting food insecurity is our mission - repurposing surplus produce is our solution.”. According to the website, “The Farmlink Project is acting as the “link” connecting the broken supply chains in the agricultural and access industries.”. The Washington Post reported in 2020 that The Farmlink Project “raises money to pay farmers for produce and dairy that would otherwise be wasted, then funds the transportation to send the goods to food banks in the neediest areas around the country.”. The Farmlink Project's website states that it will cover all shipping and logistics costs, organize and oversee all transportation and delivery logistics, work with all quantities, packaging, and produce of any form, and optimize and file for maximum possible value of tax benefits for farmers. In an interview with the Boston Globe, one of the original creators of the project explained that The Farmlink Project is founded and built by “more than 200 college students from about 30 colleges - including Stanford University, Cornell University, and Georgetown University - and other walks of life.”	The US government has launched a new project to tackle food insecurity in the US, which aims to repurposing surplus produce.
 North of Mbuamaji's old town (Currently called Gezaulole), on the seashore, is where the site is situated. A bulldozer has already damaged a portion of the site as of the early 2010s. There is a significant amount of both foreign and native cultural materials at the location. Dutch replicas of Chinese blue and white ceramics from the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as a Chinese blue and white potsherd, are examples of imported items. Other items include glass, red and white beads, Persian pottery, and red pottery from India that has black stripes painted on it. While some of the native pottery was painted in red or graphite, other pieces featured carved embellishments. The decorated ceramics are from the 12th–13th and 15th–16th centuries, respectively. A local potsherd was discovered to feature ornamental designs similar to those from Shungubweni and Pemba Mnazi. The abundance of both indigenous and imported cultural items sets the Mbuamaji site apart from all others north of Pemba Mnazi. Therefore, Mbuamaji ought to have been a very prosperous town. There is a rather modern mosque near the site with inscriptions from AH 1017 (1608 AD). Archaeologist Chittick's early research at the location reveals that the inscriptions were likely brought from another mosque because of the mosque's 19th-century Swahili architectural style. The inscriptions may be from an earlier mosque that once stood on the same spot, according to the updated dates for the location.	Archaeologists have discovered the remains of Mbuamaji, a former Swahili town which was once known as Pemba Mnazi.
" El Velorio depicts a traditional 19th-century baquiné or velorio del angelito (""wake of a little angel""), a specific type of wake with origins in Afro-Puerto Rican culture that was celebrated by jibaros and other countrymen as funerary celebrations for the death of a child. This practice originates in the syncretic Catholic and folk belief that the death of an innocent baptized child results in their automatic ascension and entrance into Heaven and that the occasion is therefore a cause not only for remembrance but for celebration. The baquiné in this portrait depicts the deceased child as a focal point dressed in white and adorned with flowers, lying on a table at the center of a traditional countryside house. The iconography of the child, reminiscent of a Christ Child, symbolizes his purity and innocence but also presents a lighter theme that separates the painting into two visual contrasts: one lighter in colors that depicts scenes of joy and celebration with food and music, and another with darker colors and shadows that depicts not only the sorrow of the child's parents but also a chaotic scene of a priest trying to perform wake rites while dogs are running around. This exemplifies the everyday clash between life and death, and between celebration and suffering, common in the life of poor countrymen in 19th-century Puerto Rico. The scene is intentionally portrayed as a judgmental satire, with Francisco Oller himself describing the scene as “an orgy of brutish appetites under the guise of gross superstition."""

 After seeing the election of Tōru Hashimoto, who also went to Osaka Prefectural Kitano High School, he retired from civil service in November 2007 and decided to become a politician. He first ran for Mayor of Taishi in 2008, but lost against two other candidates in a landslide. He ran three more times for office, twice for Mayor of Nishinomiya and once for Hyogo Prefectural Assembly, but also lost.In April 2011, Nonomura ran for Hyogo Prefectural Assembly for the Nishinomiya City constituency, which consisted of seven seats up for election. He went under the party Nishinomiya Restoration Party, and with 11,291 votes, Nonomura was elected as an assemblymember. As an assemblymember, he was active as a nonpartisan politician. On June 30, 2014, the Kobe Shimbun reported that Nonomura spent 5.64 million yen on political activity expenses during the 2013 fiscal year, exceeding the average of 5.22 million yen spent by most assemblymembers, which included multiple trips to an onsen in Toyooka as well as multiple trips to Sayō. It was later determined that it would be impossible for Nonomura to attend all trips, with Nonomura's private schedules having no indication of multiple trips.

 The Alvars (Tamil: ஆழ்வார், romanized: Āḻvār, lit. 'The Immersed') were the Tamil poet-saints of South India who espoused bhakti (devotion) to the Hindu deity Maha Vishnu, in their songs of longing, ecstasy, and service. They are venerated in Vaishnavism, which regards Vishnu as the Ultimate Reality. The devotional outpourings of the Alvars, composed during the early medieval period of Tamil history, were the catalysts behind the Bhakti Movement through their hymns of worship to Vishnu and his avatars. They praised the Divya Desams, the 108 divine realms of deities affiliated to Vaishnavism. The poetry of the Alvars echoes bhakti to God through love, and in the ecstasy of such devotions they sang hundreds of songs which embodied both depth of feeling and the felicity of expressions. The collection of their hymns is known as the Naalayira Divya Prabandham. The bhakti literature that sprang from Alvars has contributed to the establishment and sustenance of a culture that deviated from the Vedic religion and rooted itself in devotion as the only path for salvation. In addition, they contributed to Tamil devotional verses independent of a knowledge of Sanskrit.	The Alvars, the poets of South India who inspired the Bhakti Movement, have died at the age of 99.
 For a number of years there had been a disagreement in Scottish athletics over whether professional cycle racing events should be allowed at amateur athletics meetings. There were strong views both in favour and against the position, and arriving at a deadlock in their negotiations several western district clubs in favour of allowing professional cycle events, led by Clydesdale Harriers, seceded from the SAAA and formed the Scottish Amateur Athletics Union (SAAU). The consequence of this was that there were two national championships in both 1895 and 1896 held under the auspices of the two separate bodies. In both years the two championships were held on the same day, with the SAAA adhering to their policy of alternating between an Eastern and a Western venue, while the SAAU held their championship at Hampden Park, Glasgow on both occasions. == References ==	The Scottish Amateur Athletics Association (SAAA) was formed in 1891, and the first national championships were held in 1896, both at Hampden Park, Glasgow.
 In 1541, 1542 or 1543 (sources differ) Portugal established contact with Japan. Japan was then involved in a long civil-war but since Ming China had officially cut relations with Japan meant that Portuguese merchants could serve as an profitable commercial intermediary between the two nations. In 1550, the Portuguese Crown created an official trade route linking Goa, capital of its holdings in Asia, and Japan, and every year one or a number of large tradeships would sail to Japan and back, commanded by a captain-major. The Portuguese found enthusiastic commercial and diplomatical partners among Japanese lords and some, like Ōtomo Sōrin and Ōmura Sumitada converted to Christianity. Instability in Japan, or other reasons, meant that the Portuguese would occasionally be drawn into internal Japanese conflicts.

 The result was Selangor's biggest league victory in 87 years. Kelantan has now broken the Malaysian football record with recorded 106 goals conceded in all competitions this season including a record breaking 87 goals conceded in the Super League. On previous results they also lost with a big score to Terengganu with a result of 8–0 in the league match and also Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT) with a result of 10–0 in the cup match. Kelantan head coach Angel Alfredo Vera said that the lack of imported players in his squad was one of the reasons for the team’s crushing big loss defeat to Selangor in their Super League match. He shrugged off the result saying, “We didn’t have players who could dominate this match, especially imported players. The players we have are very young, they don’t have the experience, on average they have only played five Super League matches,” he told the post-match press conference. The outcome was also the worst loss by a home team in Malaysian football history, as the eleventh-goal difference doubled the previous record margin. == References ==	The result was Selangor's biggest league victory in 87 years.

The legs are short, strong, and solid. The breed is renowned for its solid constitution. The average height is 1.28 m, 1.27 m for mares, and 1.30 m for males. Weight ranges from 300 to 360 kg, with an average of 360 for males and 300 for females. There are variations according to type. For example, the University of Oklahoma study, dating from 2007, gives a size range from 1.21 to 1.42 m, and CAB International, in its study published in 2016, 1.22 to 1.42 m. Size increases markedly when environmental conditions are favorable.	A conformational model of the Chinese Japanese that is considered locally as a horse because of this model and not as a pony.
 According to legend, seeds of cannabis were brought to Naogaon District for cultivation from Jessore District before 1857 and were first planted. However, according to history, after the establishment of a cannabis hub in Naogaon, Bengal Presidency in 1906, the government of the British Raj started the first commercial cultivation of cannabis in the region Bengal. The government then appointed a registrar to collect revenue from the hub. In 1917, a cooperative society named the Ganja Society was established for the welfare of the 7,000 cannabis growers of Naogaon. The shares of the co-operative society were then sold to the farmers at the rate of ten rupees each, whereby the farmers became its partners. A warehouse was built there to store the produced cannabis. It was inaugurated in 1921 by Syed Nawab Ali Chowdhury, one of the provincial ministers of Bengal. In 1974, the government of Bangladesh signed the Geneva Conventions, which forced the government to withdraw from cannabis production. In 1975, the Ganja Society set up a 1,000 metric ton capacity cold storage facility with three chambers. According to the agreement, the activities of the Ganja Society came to a standstill in 1987 when the cultivation of cannabis was banned. After the ban was announced, the government locked up the Ganja Society's warehouses with manufactured cannabis.	Cannabis has been used as a recreational drug in Bangladesh for more than 100 years, but its use was banned by the government of Bangladesh in 1987.

" The undeclared war between the United Kingdom and Argentina in April 1982 posed a problem for the editorial staff of Battle. While the British response to what was viewed as an invasion of British territory produced a boom in patriotism and interest in warfare, Battle editor Terry Magee, boys' adventure group editor Barrie Tomlinson and managing editor John Sanders ultimately agreed that 'cashing in' on the conflict would be in poor taste. As it was, the fighting concluded on 14 June 1982 and IPC swiftly planned coverage. To maintain decorum over a conflict which had seen 255 British deaths, it was decided to make a documentary-style strip simply recounting the events with no overt fictional elements. Battle co-creator and frequent contributor John Wagner was eager to write the strip, recalling he was ""ready to go"" and ""was all for bashing the Argies"" at the time. Stalwart Jim Watson drew the comic."	The Battle of the Somme is one of the most famous strips in British comic book history and was first published in IPC's Battle magazine in June 1982.

" In 1918, Wimble built a small ship at Hastings with help from a friend and sailed to the West Indies to seek his fortune after his family faced financial hardship. In 1922, he acquired land in the Bahamas which enabled him to begin trading with the English colonies in mainland North America. He also acquired land in North Carolina, which was formally granted to him by George Burrington's council on August 4, 1723. Wimble later moved to Boston, Massachusetts where he married Rebecca Waters, the daughter of a prominent local, on March 26, 1724. Their first son, James, was born on December 20, 1724. He owned land in the South End which he presumably operated as a distillery. While in Boston, he continued his business of moving trade goods between North Carolina and various British trade posts in the West Indies. This business enabled him to increase his land holdings in North Carolina and purchase a brigantine, which he named ""Rebecca"" after his wife. In 1932, Wimble lost his ship and all of its cargo to a hurricane after being forced by Governor Woodes Rogers of the Bahamas to use his ship to protect vessels and salt ponds in Rum Cay. Wimble was forced to sell a portion of his belongings, land, and slaves to cover the loss and began the process of trying to collect damages from Woodes Rogers' commandeering of his ship."

 Emperors Leopold I and Joseph I were striving to restore their rights in imperial Italy. A major point of contention regarded Parma and Piacenza, both of which were claimed by the Emperor and the Pope simultaneously. After the Siege of Turin during the War of the Spanish Succession, Joseph I strengthened his efforts to restore imperial rights in Italy. That the Pope had sided with the Bourbons against the Habsburgs also played a role in the conflict. In 1701, he had recognized Phillip of Anjou as the King of Spain. Concessions made by the Emperor to Lutherans in Silesia had also displeased the Pope. Papal territories had already been occupied by imperial forces in the campaigns of 1706 and 1707. In the territories considered to be part of the Empire, war taxes were levied. The Pope had retaliated with ecclesiastical penalties directed at imperial commanders and officials. Rinaldo d’Este, Duke of Modena, had sided with the Emperor, and his territories had suffered at the hands of French troops. He proceeded to claim the rule of the Duchy of Ferrara and the County of Comacchio. Both of these areas belonged to the Papal States. However, the Duke presented documents that stated the territories were really part of the Empire. His account of the matter was believed in Vienna. The Emperor allowed General Claude Alexandre de Bonneval to occupy Comacchio on May 24th, 1708. The imperial troops began to fortify the city and built a tower with an inscription meant to strengthen the imperial claim. These events triggered an open conflict. Behind the decision to escalate stood among others the Empress Wilhelmine Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg, who was also the sister of the Duchess of Modena. Another force behind the move was Charles Theodore, Prince of Salm. The Emperor himself approved the course of action, although Eugene of Savoy and others had advised against it. The goal was the Pope’s recognition of Archduke Charles as King of Spain and the expansion of imperial influence in Italy. A statement was released sharply criticizing the politics of the Pope. The Pope was accused of usurping feudal rights over Parma and Piacenza, supporting France, and punishing the imperial generals with unjust ecclesiastical rulings. This statement was interpreted by the papal court as a declaration of war.	The conflict between the Emperor Leopold I of Austria and the Pope of Rome in 1708 was one of the bloodiest in the history of the Papal States.
 The slow transition from small foraging and hunter/gathering groups to more advanced agricultural societies began four to six thousand years ago in the Amazon Basin, with the exact timing varying by sub-region. These more advanced farming systems involved intensive arboriculture as well as staple root and seed crops that supported stable settlements with relatively large populations. Reports by early European explorers described large “well-fed populations along the bluffs, surrounded by orchards on the uplands and seasonal fields in the floodplains.” As elsewhere in the Americas, the European conquest brought the collapse of indigenous populations and their advanced agricultural systems were largely forgotten. Starting in roughly the year 2000, formal research projects (using molecular data, microfossil botanical techniques, remote sensing, and plant genetics) have resurrected the story of human settlement of the Amazon Basin – it is no longer thought to have been a primeval forest at the time of European contact and can now be considered, along with Mesoamerica, as an “early and independent cradle of agriculture”.The principal features of these agricultural practices are as follows:	The transition from small foraging and hunter/gathering groups to more advanced agricultural societies began four to six thousand years ago in the Amazon Basin.

" The uprising was subject to intense criticism from Ukrainian left-wing nationalist figures. Mykhailo Hrushevsky, Ukrainian head of state prior to Skoropadskyi's coup d'état, allegedly described it as the ""darkest moment of the Ukrainian revolution."" The left wing of the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party also condemned the uprising as ""counter-revolutionary."" The Ukrainian populace reacted with ambivalence, by this point exhausted after a year of political turmoil, though Petliura faced criticism in non-partisan press organs. The remaining German soldiers in Kyiv, seeking to evacuate after the collapse of the German Empire, were primarily concerned with the continued operation of the Korosten railway station, which would allow them to return to Germany. Converesely, in Bolshevik circles, the uprising was met with support. Prior to the uprising's beginning, Bolsheviks Christian Rakovsky and Dmitry Manuilsky met with the Directorate's leaders, where they agreed to support the Directorate through ceasefire violations and recognition of the Ukrainian People's Republic in return for the legalisation of the Communist Party of Ukraine. These agreements were a tactical move by the Bolsheviks, as part of a broader campaign to weaken Ukrainian nationalists and strengthen the position of communist insurgent groups. Other left-wing groups from throughout the Russian Empire, including the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and anarchists, also supported the uprising."	Ukrainian President Viktor Skoropadskyi declared the creation of the Ukrainian People's Republic on 1 July 1917, after the overthrow of the Directorate of National Defence.
 What was initially reported as sewage was found to be about 1,000 US gallons (3,800 L; 830 imp gal) of a chemical mixture consisting of some sort of organic peroxide. In the first days of the investigation, officials speculated that two inert chemicals accidentally mixed in the truck and created an organic peroxide substance with sulfuric acid appearing to be part of the mix. Organic peroxide combines unstably bound oxygen together with hydrogen and carbon in the same molecule and ignites easily and then burns rapidly and intensely. While field testing was performed on the reactive material for initial identification, the county hazardous materials manager found that laboratories would not test the chemicals over concerns that lab personnel could be injured or their equipment damaged. Three weeks after the incident, the substance was still highly susceptible to friction and seemed to react to something as slight as wind. Sodium chlorite was identified in an internal investigation by the firm in the months following the disaster. They claimed that the chemical was being using as a water treatment agent for the first time and was stored in the same type of storage container as wastewater. The company said they treat about 100 different streams of waste. The owner of facility said that they never had a major problem such as this since the plant only takes non-hazardous waste. The worker combined the chemical with wastewater in the vacuum truck where the chemical interacting with organic material caused an explosion that blew off the back of the truck. A former county district attorney, retained by a company attorney, issued a report in March 2015 that provided an explanation of events indicating that the worker may have accidentally combined the chemicals. Later, investigators found that an inspection by a Defense Logistics Agency contractor was scheduled for that morning and officials of the firm had directed the transfer of these hazardous materials to another location.	A worker working at a waste treatment plant in the US state of California accidentally combined a chemical with wastewater in a vacuum truck and caused an explosion that blew off the back of the truck.
" The mining companies that were involved, and most prominent in the Vancouver Islands at the time, were: The Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Limited, the Western Fuel of San Francisco, the Pacific Coast Collieries, and the Nanaimo Coal Company. The Canadian Collieries were based in Cumberland and Extension. Owned by the Dunsmuir family, the company played a significant role in the strike by firing a union leader with the last name ""Mottishaw"". This was one of the strike's leading causes. The Western Fuel of San Francisco was based in Nanaimo and owned many of the mines there. The Pacific Coast Collieries only had minor involvement, and were located in South Wellington. The Nanaimo Coal Company stands apart from the other three, as it was the sole company to ""sign an agreement with the union. ""These mining companies (excluding the Nanaimo Coal Company) were opposed to the unions, because they were a threat to the coal companies' power and authority. They coal companies were also dealing with the competition of fuel oil. Because of the potential replacement of coal as fuel with oil as fuel, they worked the miners extra hard and with less pay. This was in an effort to keep up with fuel oil and to stay in business. They needed to pay workers less in order to make a profit. However, unions demanded more pay, causing an issue for the coal companies. They did not want to increase the miners' pay, at the risk of losing their business, and of the entire coal mining industry being replaced by an alternate fuel source. They also had the support of the government, because the economy was so dependent upon the coal industry."	The Canadian miners' strike in the 1970s and 80s was a major cause for the collapse of the coal industry.

 Chandramukhi was one of the esteemed courtesans of the kingdom of Vijayanagaram. Famous for her beauty as well as her singing and dancing skills, she becomes a royal court dancer. She was in love with Gunasekaran, a fellow court dancer who loved her equally and the pair performed together in court at times. Chandramukhi leads a normal life before Vettaiyan kills her and Gunasekaran. In her spirit form she becomes a force of blind rage and grief with hostile intentions. However she appears to be patient in her goal and possesses Ganga like a parasite, slowly transferring her personality into the host. Throughout it, her host will merge behaviors with her and replicate how the spirit acted in her lifetime, for example, a trait of Chandramukhi was excessive vanity and obsession with how beautiful she looked. In her fully possessed form, Chandramukhi is a compulsive dancer who enjoys listening to the sound of her voice. She also has a demonic and murderous personality when confronted with whom she believes to be Vettaiyan.	A story of a court dancer who becomes a force of blind rage and grief with hostile intentions.

 Maurice-Mollard Plaza features a monumental, flower-filled fountain at its center, raised on porphyry paving stones. The northern part of the square is embellished with tree-lined avenues, bordering Les Thermes Plaza and the Square du Temple de Diane d'Aix-les-Bains. A grassy area planted with trees and flowers occupies the southern part of the square, in the middle of which stands a staircase giving access to Lord-Revelstoke Avenue (D913). Here, you'll find the Hôtel de Ville square, located above the entrance to the underground parking lot. Several historic monuments are located on and near the square: The Aix-les-Bains town hall, resulting from the redevelopment of a 16th-century château, has been listed as a historic monument since August 7th, 1890 for its staircase, and since December 11th, 1982 for the entire building apart from the north wing. The Temple of Diane in Aix-les-Bains, adjoining the town hall to the northwest, is one of only three classical-style Roman temples to have been completely preserved in France, alongside the Maison Carrée in Nîmes and the Temple of Augustus and Livia in Vienne, and has been listed as a historic monument since 1875. The former national thermal baths of Aix-les-Bains have an entrance on the Maurice-Mollard Plaza side leading to the 913 departmental road. The building has been listed as a historic monument since April 24th, 1986. The Arch of Campanus, a Roman monument dating from the 1st century B.C., has been listed since August 7th, 1890. To the south of the square lies the Thermes floral park, once considered the city's most beautiful promenade. It was listed on April 23th, 2008.	The central square of Aix-les-Bains is one of the city's best-known landmarks, and has been listed as a historic monument since 1875.
" In 2011, The Alaska Design Forum, in collaboration with the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), embarked on a public art project that aimed to ignite conversations about shared spaces. This project resulted in a giant banner with the words ""Looking For Love Again"" hanging on the west face of the Polaris Building. The project sought to engage the public in a meaningful way and was designed by Candy Chang, a graphic and urban designer known for her work in struggling communities. The project featured two chalkboards at the base of the building, inviting passersby to share their memories and hopes related to the Polaris Building. Drawing inspiration from a similar endeavor in New Orleans, Candy Chang sought to evoke a sense of community ownership and empowerment by encouraging individuals to articulate their desires for their neighborhood. The 40 by 80-foot ""Looking For Love Again"" banner was vandalized and cut down in the summer of 2014."

 Of the monetary units that are included in the ISO 4217 standard and exist in cash, only the Panamanian balboa is not issued in the form of banknotes - the local population in Panama uses balboa coins and US dollar banknotes. Also, in real money circulation, there are some other monetary units only in the form of coins. This is due to the spread of a parallel currency in the relevant territory: Tuvaluan dollar and Kiribati dollar - Australian dollar banknotes are used; Pitcairn Islands dollar - banknotes of the New Zealand dollar are used; Timorese and Ecuadorian centavo - US dollar banknotes are used; in Madagascar, coins of the Malagasy franc remain in circulation, while banknotes and coins of the Malagasy ariary are mainly used.	In our series of letters from African journalists, the Panamanian balboa has been named as the world's largest currency.
 The competition consisted of 80 teams: 48 championship division teams and 32 open division teams. Each of these divisions were further divided into two equal sized divisions for men and women. The championship division divided teams into eight groups of three teams each while the open division divided teams into four groups of four teams each, both engaging in a round-robin tournament that determined teams able to advance to a knockout stage. Pool play games were two 40-minute halves, separated by a seven-minute halftime and utilized the three points for a win system. After group stage play, the two highest ranked teams from each group advanced to their respective knockout stage. In the championship division, the third placed team advanced to a consolation bracket while in the open division, the third and fourth placed teams were eliminated. Knockout stage games also consisted of two 40-minute halves. The round of 16 and quarterfinals were separated by a seven-minute halftime while the semifinals and finals had a ten-minute halftime. Knockout stage games needed to declare a winner, therefore if a game was tied at the end of regulation, one 15-minute, golden-goal overtime period would begin. If still tied after overtime, kicks from the mark would determine the winner.	The competition consisted of 80 teams: 48 championship division teams and 32 open division teams.

 This dish lends itself to many variations and is sometimes confused with Syracuse sauce (because of the presence of anchovies), the original recipe of which, however, often uses short pasta and does not involve the use of breadcrumbs, but rather a generous amount of vegetables, capers and olives; these are foods that are not present in the traditional recipe of this dish, with the rare exception of olives, which are black.It should also not be confused with the first course, especially in Palermo, called pasta with sardines: although tradition says it was born in the Syracuse area (but by cooks of the Arab army, camped there to conquer the city), it is quite distant from the culinary customs of the Syracuse area, considering ingredients such as raisins and pine nuts (a classic combination of Palermo cuisine), as well as saffron, and the fish that dominates the dish is sardine, not anchovy. The toasted breadcrumbs in the original pasta with sardines are not present.

 The watershed of what is just called the Winter brook encompasses entirely the watershed of the Winter brook, Big brook, Black Water, and Hulpe. The source area of the Winter brook is in Korspel, a hamlet of Beringen. In the downstream direction to the west, three streams combine to contribute to the flow of the Winter brook, among them the Genemeer brook. As a result of mine subsidence, the water management in this source area was disturbed, leading to the reversal of the flow direction of the Genemeer brook, which ceased to join the Winter brook. As a result, a new connection was established from the source area of this stream to Winter brook. Between the villages of Beverlo and Beringen Mine, the brook flows westward, guided through a siphon under the Albert Canal. It now continues southwestward, passing to the north of the Paalse Lake and southeast of Tessenderlo and Deurne. Until this stage, it falls within the classification as a second-class non-navigable watercourse. Near the Paalse Lake, it becomes a watercourse of the first category due to high pollution. Further downstream, Small brook and Middle brook (Dutch:Middelbeek) run parallel to the Winter brook, and the name changes to Big brook. The valley with these parallel running streams is known as the Valley of the Three Brooks. The brook flows south of Deurne, along the area of Asdonk. When the Small brook merges into the Big brook, the name changes to Black Water. This name is given to the dark color that the water acquires due to the presence of peat soil. Beyond Molenstede, there is another name change, and the brook becomes the Hulpe, named after a significant side stream that joins it. Under the name Hulpe, it flows through the Demer Marshes before finally joining the Demer River. In the western part of the watershed, the valley is flanked by escarpments composed of iron sandstone. These escarpments are up to 30 meters higher than their surroundings.	The Winter brook is a watercourse in the Dutch valleys of Molenwijk and Demer, where it runs.
" After the general elections of November 2019 and the start of the 14th legislature, acting Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez (PSOE) required the abstention of the leading political parties of the nationalist left, the Catalan ERC and Basque EH Bildu, in order to form his second government during the January 2020 parliamentary session. This gesture, among other minor arrangements with EH Bildu, was a central element of criticism by the Spanish political right (mainly the People's Party and Vox). Francisco Javier García Gaztelu, nicknamed ""Txapote"", was one of the main leaders of the Basque terrorist group ETA.

 Emperors Leopold I and Joseph I were striving to restore their rights in imperial Italy. A major point of contention regarded Parma and Piacenza, both of which were claimed by the Emperor and the Pope simultaneously. After the Siege of Turin during the War of the Spanish Succession, Joseph I strengthened his efforts to restore imperial rights in Italy. That the Pope had sided with the Bourbons against the Habsburgs also played a role in the conflict. In 1701, he had recognized Phillip of Anjou as the King of Spain. Concessions made by the Emperor to Lutherans in Silesia had also displeased the Pope. Papal territories had already been occupied by imperial forces in the campaigns of 1706 and 1707. In the territories considered to be part of the Empire, war taxes were levied. The Pope had retaliated with ecclesiastical penalties directed at imperial commanders and officials. Rinaldo d’Este, Duke of Modena, had sided with the Emperor, and his territories had suffered at the hands of French troops. He proceeded to claim the rule of the Duchy of Ferrara and the County of Comacchio. Both of these areas belonged to the Papal States. However, the Duke presented documents that stated the territories were really part of the Empire. His account of the matter was believed in Vienna. The Emperor allowed General Claude Alexandre de Bonneval to occupy Comacchio on May 24th, 1708. The imperial troops began to fortify the city and built a tower with an inscription meant to strengthen the imperial claim. These events triggered an open conflict. Behind the decision to escalate stood among others the Empress Wilhelmine Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg, who was also the sister of the Duchess of Modena. Another force behind the move was Charles Theodore, Prince of Salm. The Emperor himself approved the course of action, although Eugene of Savoy and others had advised against it. The goal was the Pope’s recognition of Archduke Charles as King of Spain and the expansion of imperial influence in Italy. A statement was released sharply criticizing the politics of the Pope. The Pope was accused of usurping feudal rights over Parma and Piacenza, supporting France, and punishing the imperial generals with unjust ecclesiastical rulings. This statement was interpreted by the papal court as a declaration of war.	A method of warfare comprising the steps of: occupying a plurality of occupied territories; occupying a city with the aid of the occupying forces; and establishing a tower with an inscription meant to strengthen the claim of the occupying forces.
" Boskovich (1956–2006) studied at the California Institute of the Arts under the tutelage of conceptual artist John Baldessari. His work has been cited as drawing heavily from Dadaism, and frequently utilised objects, photography, handwritten and typeset texts and audio sources to create ""witty and sharp-edged social commentary"". Boskovich was in a relationship with Stephen Earabino, a fashion stylist originally from Massachusetts, with whom he lived in an apartment in Los Angeles, California. In 1995, Earabino died from AIDS-related complications. Shortly after his death, Earabino's family emptied out the flat Earabino shared with Boskovich, removing all of his items, as well as most of Boskovich's, with the only remaining item being an electric box fan."

" Clarke Garrison was portrayed from 1987 to 1992 and from 1996 to 2009 by Daniel McVicar. McVicar describes Clarke as ""the classic heel with a heart, a cad with a conscience"". He is a former fashion designer for the now-defunct Spectra Fashions. Originally a student at Otis Parsons Institute the eternally ambitious character has always wrestled with the balance between ambition and questions of the heart. He has two sons, C.J. (Mick Cain) from his marriage to Sally Spectra (played by Darlene Conley), and Mark (Michael Dietz) from his affair with Margo Lynley (Lauren Koslow). He was also once married to Kristen Forrester (then played by Teri Ann Linn). Their relationship began when Kristen's mother, Stephanie (Susan Flannery), hired Clarke to seduce Kristen, fearing that her daughter was frigid. Clarke began to have feelings for Kristen and they married, before splitting later. Clarke left town in September 1992, returning four years later to see his son, C.J. (then played by Kyle Sabihy). C.J. wanted nothing to do with his father, angry at Clarke for walking out on him and Sally. This changed when Clarke rescued him from kidnappers. Clarke and Sally remained close friends; she affectionately called him ""Bucky"". He also shared a bond with Sally's former receptionist, Darla (Schae Harrison), who Sally thought of as a daughter. After a disastrous flirtation with Morgan DeWitt (Sarah Buxton), which almost ended with Clarke being killed by her pet python, ""Patsy"", Clarke began to woo a recently returned Kristen (now Tracy Melchior). His attempts at seducing his ex-wife were unsuccessful, as Kristen moved on with Tony Dominguez (Paulo Benedeti). Clarke's most notable lapse in judgement was in early 2005, when he reluctantly helped a vengeful Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz) trap Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss) and his stepdaughter Bridget Forrester (Ashley Jones) down a mineshaft in the hope that they would give into their ""feelings"" for one another, destroying Ridge's marriage to Bridget's mother, Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang). Amber received the ammunition she needed, and she and Clarke escaped prosecution due to Sally's pleas for Stephanie not to press charges. It seems, however, that the Forresters have forgiven Clarke for this crime, as he is often present at their family gatherings. Until recently Clarke worked at Forrester Creations, as the new head designer, after being hired by the new owners at that time, Nick (Jack Wagner) and Jackie Marone (Lesley-Anne Down). He was demoted to designer after Brooke returned to Forrester Creations and was made head designer. After Eric Forrester (John McCook) bought back Forrester Creations, he was under no obligation to honor Clarke's contract and Clarke was released from the company. Not too long after Jackie Marone and Dominick Marone sold Forrester Creations back to the Forresters, Clarke found himself once again back at Spectra Fashions. Because the new owners of Spectra Fashions had gone bankrupt, the company was reverted to Sally Spectra. As she no longer wanted to run the business, Sally Spectra asked Clarke and their son C.J. to sell the business for her. Knowing Jackie and her son would be interested, Clarke made his way to their home. One thing led to the next and Nick purchased the company making Clarke their head designer. The company was later renamed ""M Fashions"". Clarke worked at Jackie M Designs, the company formerly known as Spectra Fashions."

 On the amavasya (new moon day) of the Hindu month of Ashadha, devotees observe Dashama vrat by installing a Sandhani made of soil in their home. Devotees also install a murti (icon) or image of the goddess Dashama with an icon of the Hindu god Ganesha. Devotees who observe this vrat wear the Kautuka (red-coloured thread) with 10 knots on their right hand on the first day and eat once a day (ek tanu). Daily, devotees perform puja (ritual worship), Aarti, reads the katha (legend) and then eats prasadi (food offering). Devotees also participate in Jagaran, a night vigil of prayer and worship. The vrat is observed for 10 days. On the last day, devotees observe the jagaran and around 4-5 AM, the murti is immersed into a water body like a river.

 William Bentall, a farmer who lived in Goldhanger, invented some time between 1760 and 1790 the Goldhanger plough (also known as the Essex plough), which was put on the market in 1797. In 1805, William Bentall formed a company to manufacture agricultural equipment sited on the south bank of the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation. In 1814, William's son Edward Hammond Bentall was born. Edward joined the firm at 22 in 1836, and by 1839 he had incorporated it as E.H. Bentall & Co., and in 1841 patented an improved version of his father's Goldhanger Plow. In 1851, Edward's 1843 patented design for the Broad Share Cultivator won the company the gold medal at the Great Exhibition, with a further three first prizes at the Royal Agricultural Society Show in 1859. Other patented inventions by Edward included the improved oil cake mill and the prize root pulper, which both won first prize at the Royal Society meet at Chester in 1858. With these successes Bentall's reputation grew and orders were coming in from all over the world. During the mid-1800s Bentall's started building housing for their staff. By 1889 Edward's son, Edmund Ernest Bentall had started to run the business.	Bentall's is one of the oldest companies in the world, having been founded in Essex more than 200 years ago by the same man who invented the plough.
 Nigeria received an RFI emergency loan for economic losses incurred due to COVID-19, which is to be repaid within 5 years, and repayments beginning within the third year. The RFI loan was conditioned upon the nation's adherence to transparency and participation in independent audits of crisis-mitigation. Moreover, Nigeria agreed to publish emergency expenses to ensure the loan was being utilized for its specified purpose. There was a severe drop in international demand and oil prices by 2020, resulting in exports decline of more than US$26 billion.In June 2022, under the leadership of IMF's Mission Chief in Nigeria, Jesmin Rahman, convened several meetings assessing the present condition of the Nigerian economy following COVID-19, the 2020 RFI loan, and the repercussions of the Russia-Ukraine war. In May 2022, inflation grew to 17.7 percent, creating new economic and social concerns, particularly among the over 40 percent of the Nigerian population that live below the poverty line and face severe food insecurity. == References ==	Nigeria received an RFI emergency loan for economic losses incurred due to COVID-19.

 What was initially reported as sewage was found to be about 1,000 US gallons (3,800 L; 830 imp gal) of a chemical mixture consisting of some sort of organic peroxide. In the first days of the investigation, officials speculated that two inert chemicals accidentally mixed in the truck and created an organic peroxide substance with sulfuric acid appearing to be part of the mix. Organic peroxide combines unstably bound oxygen together with hydrogen and carbon in the same molecule and ignites easily and then burns rapidly and intensely. While field testing was performed on the reactive material for initial identification, the county hazardous materials manager found that laboratories would not test the chemicals over concerns that lab personnel could be injured or their equipment damaged. Three weeks after the incident, the substance was still highly susceptible to friction and seemed to react to something as slight as wind. Sodium chlorite was identified in an internal investigation by the firm in the months following the disaster. They claimed that the chemical was being using as a water treatment agent for the first time and was stored in the same type of storage container as wastewater. The company said they treat about 100 different streams of waste. The owner of facility said that they never had a major problem such as this since the plant only takes non-hazardous waste. The worker combined the chemical with wastewater in the vacuum truck where the chemical interacting with organic material caused an explosion that blew off the back of the truck. A former county district attorney, retained by a company attorney, issued a report in March 2015 that provided an explanation of events indicating that the worker may have accidentally combined the chemicals. Later, investigators found that an inspection by a Defense Logistics Agency contractor was scheduled for that morning and officials of the firm had directed the transfer of these hazardous materials to another location.

 The cave is located in the Thal-Kittelsthal karst complex, a former Zechstein reef. This region was in a threshold position at the beginning of the Zechstein period; Thuringia was covered by the Zechstein Sea, which had only a shallow water depth in this threshold region. In these shallow water areas, favored by the climatic conditions, many calcareous coral reef found a habitat. These reef-builders died off under increasingly inhospitable living conditions and were gradually covered by sediments of the higher Zechstein. The Thuringian Forest was uplifted by Saxonian fracture block tectonics; to a lesser extent this also affected areas of the foreland such as the Kittelsthal region, parts of which were later eroded again. This provided favorable conditions for karstification. Water sank over fissures and ponors in the reef complex and the dripstone caves began to form. In larger cavities, the dissolution of the limestone by carbonic acid formed stalactites, stalagmites and stalagnates of various sizes and shapes. In the cave there are also sporadic eccentrics, sideways or upward curved outgrowths of a few centimeters in length, independent of gravity.	The dripstone cave in Thuringia, which has been built in the early stages of the Zechstein period, is a remarkable habitat for coral reef-builders.
 In total, 191 civilians were killed by the clashes and massacres by the two gangs, although the real total is unknown, due to many bodies having not been found. Ten members of Chen Mechan were killed, including the seven by Celestin. Haitian authorities arrested three people, including the leader of the 400 Mawozo-affiliated Baz 222 gang. The police also installed new checkpoints in Plaine du Cul-de-Sac following the clashes. Several weapons were seized as well. In Butte Boyer, every house was searched and then destroyed by Chen Mechan. In other neighborhoods, eighty-one houses in total were destroyed in the fighting. By June 27, 2022, there had been no trials of the three gang members arrested. The Haitian government had also not released a statement by that time. Chen Mechan members were still conducting raids in Plaine du Cul-de-Sac in late June, looking for 400 Mawozo informants. Many of the displaced fled to the Clericine public square, a majority of whom do not want to return.

 During the late 19th century, the growth of Oberschöneweide and Niederschöneweide was closely linked to the rapid expansion of Berlin's large-scale industry. The presence of railways and waterways provided favorable conditions for the establishment of industrial settlements. At the same time, however, constructing paths and roads and connecting them to the Chausseenetz of the district of Teltow became necessary. To create the first permanent link between the two banks of the Spree River, a chain ferry was established in 1885, and funded by the district. The ferry connection operated until 1891 when it was replaced by a wooden bridge in 1890/1891. This bridge also accommodated the tracks of the Oberschöneweide industrial railroad (Bullenbahn), which connected seventeen newly established factories in Oberschöneweide to the Berlin-Görlitz railroad line. The 121-meter-long bridge over the Spree was a wooden truss structure with nine openings, with three in the middle serving as ship passages. In addition to this bridge, other Spree crossings were built around the same time, such as the Kaisersteg (1898, pedestrian bridge) and the Treskowbrücke (1904), which together helped to relieve traffic in Schöneweide. However, the wooden bridge quickly deteriorated and, after only ten years, a new fixed crossing was urgently needed. The district administration opted for a steel bridge constructed of three arches of unequal length, which also had to accommodate the tracks of the industrial railroad leading to the Oberschöneweide factories. The new construction led to re-routing streetcar lines operated by the Berlin Ostbahnhof exclusively over the neighboring Treskow Bridge. The bridge plans were developed by Berlin civil engineer Karl Bernhard, who was also responsible for the superstructure. Preparatory work began in 1905, and the entire construction costs were covered by the municipality. Before the new Stubenrauch Bridge was built, there was only the Kaisersteg for pedestrians to cross the Spree and the later Treskow Bridge for vehicles, but the latter was a rather dilapidated wooden structure at the time. When the new bridge was inaugurated, it was named Stubenrauchbrücke in honor of the former Teltow district administrator, Ernst von Stubenrauch.

Miller believes that its use in the USA stems from the bosal hackamore of the Vaqueros, which has been adopted by almost all practitioners of natural horsemanship in the form of a rope halter with knots. According to Cynthia McFarland, American cowboys were the first to discover and make a rope halter. The use of this equipment spread from the United States to France in the early 2000s, as well as to Germany, accompanying the development of ethological equitation. French rider Michel Robert is a pioneer in the world of show jumping. Equestrian equipment manufacturers have adapted to demand. Many now offer this type of halter for sale, with a wide choice of models, colors and materials, and knots that can be placed in different ways. In the United States, the marketing of an ethological halter supposed to make horses softer, under the name of be-nice, has sparked debate.	The ethological halter is a type of rope halter that has been popular in the United States since the 1970s, and has spread to other countries as well.
 In December of that year, They crossed the Heilong River and were stationed in the Russian Free City Srabske area. With the help of 500,000 Koreans and the Russian Red Army, they received weapons replenishment and sometimes participated in joint operations. Meanwhile, in February 1921, a military agreement was signed between the buffer government in Chita and the anti-Japanese independence army through the good offices of Ohamuk, a graduate of the Russian Military Academy who participated in the Russian Revolution. According to this military agreement, the independence army received weapons from them, established the Goryeo Revolutionary Military Academy (高麗革命軍官學校) to train the independence army, and participated in the subjugation of the Baekgye Army. Knowing this, Japan launched a robust diplomatic offensive against the Russian government and demanded that it disarm. Meanwhile, Russia, anxious about domestic civil war after the revolution, was wary of discord with Japan and promised to disarm the Korean Independence Army. Accordingly, on June 22, 1921, the Russian authorities issued an order to the Korean independence forces stationed in Heilongjiang Jayu City to disarm and, at the same time, attack and defeat the resisting independence forces, causing the Jayu City Incident. At this time, the Independence Army units suffered many casualties and suffered untold hardships, causing the Korean Independence Corps to disintegrate.

" Since the establishment of the standard, the policy for compiling dictionaries has been to publish character books that are based on the assumption that all JIS basic Kanji characters are listed. However, for ghost characters included in JIS Basic Kanji, it is not possible to refer to past sources. Therefore, their treatment differed depending on the dictionaries and individual characters as follows. Assign readings for convenienceIn information equipment that implements JIS basic Kanji characters, it is not good enough that even ghost characters do not appear when converted as long as they are implemented. Therefore, they are often assigned a ""phonetic reading,"" which is interpreted as a form of phonetic writing for convenience. Some dictionaries also list these convenient readings. Hiroyuki Sasahara points out that these readings may have been given based on a research report by the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (1982) and published materials by NEC (1982) and IBM Japan (1983). Regarded as Glyph with similar charactersSome have assigned ""駲"" as a variant of ""馴"" and ""軅"" as a variant of ""軈"". However, none of these sources provide a source.

 The site was split in two by the modern road. The buildings were placed around a large central peristyle (courtyard) garden. The residential part (pars urbana) of the villa with a grand facade overlooking the sea is on the eastern side. On the western side of the peristyle (and the modern road) is a richly decorated large private double bath complex. The monumental baths are as big as many ancient public baths, but their richness and magnificence of decoration are more consistent with private baths in this location. Their external appearance would also have been impressive as the roofs were vaulted and domed. The two independent bath suites is a feature of other 4th century villas and may have been influenced by Christianity, which banned mixed bathing and promoted modesty among the newly converted. Other possible parts such as the pars rustica (for servants and other workers) and the pars fructaria (for the processing of products) typical of a Roman villa have not yet been found.	A Roman villa built in a medieval housing complex in the Isle of Man has been revealed by the National Museum of Art.
" In an interview with series creator Reki Kawahara, the author noted that the female characters in Sword Art Online were not based on anyone he knew in the real world, with him stating ""I don’t usually make a character, setting, or anything before I start writing. As I write the story, the girls become what they are now. So, somehow, I don’t know exactly, but somehow, my subliminal idea or some hidden emotion creates the characters to be strong and capable."" Kawahara also added that he wrote the series to demonstrate that he views online gaming not as a social ill or escape from real life, and thus decided to show games in a more positive light in his light novels."

 Henry Ross, who is believed to be the designer of the Eureka Flag, was from Toronto, Canada. The Swiss-born Charles Doudiet, whose sketchbook is held by the Art Gallery of Ballarat and contains such scenes from around the time of the armed uprising as the iconic Eureka Slaughter, had lived in Canada. Doudiet may have been present at the battle, and he notes in his sketchbook that he helped to convey his friend, the mortally wounded Ross, to the Free Trade Hotel, where the Eureka flag bearer died of a groin injury two days later. Robert Julien died defending the stockade, as did Thomas Budden, also a friend of Ross, both from Canada.	Charles Doudiet may have been present at the battle.

 Chandramukhi was one of the esteemed courtesans of the kingdom of Vijayanagaram. Famous for her beauty as well as her singing and dancing skills, she becomes a royal court dancer. She was in love with Gunasekaran, a fellow court dancer who loved her equally and the pair performed together in court at times. Chandramukhi leads a normal life before Vettaiyan kills her and Gunasekaran. In her spirit form she becomes a force of blind rage and grief with hostile intentions. However she appears to be patient in her goal and possesses Ganga like a parasite, slowly transferring her personality into the host. Throughout it, her host will merge behaviors with her and replicate how the spirit acted in her lifetime, for example, a trait of Chandramukhi was excessive vanity and obsession with how beautiful she looked. In her fully possessed form, Chandramukhi is a compulsive dancer who enjoys listening to the sound of her voice. She also has a demonic and murderous personality when confronted with whom she believes to be Vettaiyan.	The killing of Vettaiyan, a court dancer who believes to be the king of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, has led to the death of one of its most famous courtesans.
 In the men's championship division finals, the 2000 champions, Penn State, would face North Carolina in their national finals debut. While all of Penn State's previous 5 games were within a goal, North Carolina would cut it much closer, requiring extra time in their previous two games, including a nine-round penalty shootout with Illinois in the semifinals. Despite playing nearly 30 extra minutes, North Carolina started early with a goal from Eric Rossitch in the 5th minute off of a header near the 6-yard box off of a free kick. A goal in the last minute by Daniel Goff while Penn State had all 11 men in North Carolina's half would see North Carolina win 2–0. This was North Carolina's first national title and the first national title by a Region II team, the only region who hadn't had a team claim a men's championship national title. In the women's championship finals, the 2012 champions, Michigan State, would face Colorado State who were looking on claiming their fourth national title. Both teams required extra time in the semifinals and Colorado State further needed penalty kicks to decide not only the semifinals, but also the quarterfinals. Following the trend for both teams, the game would remain 0-0 after 80 minutes, meaning extra time would be required. Four minutes into extra time, eventual MVP Danielle Manning of Michigan State would break the deadlock with a sudden-victory goal that gave Michigan State their second women's national title. Both of Michigan State's titles were won in extra time. In the men's open finals, Oregon would return to the open finals after their title 10 years ago in 2005 to face UC-Davis who were making their debut. Coming in, Oregon won each of their previous 5 games by at least 2 goals while UC-Davis had only given up a single goal. UC-Davis would go up 2–1 in the match, but Oregon's Henry Fassinger would score a penalty kick late into the game to tie the game at 2-2, forcing the game into extra time. Eventual MVP, Andrew Saenz of Oregon, would score a sudden-victory goal to secure Oregon's 3–2 win and their second national title.In the women's open finals, 2012 open champions, JMU, would face last year's open runners-up UCLA. Coming in, JMU would require a penalty shootout in the quarterfinals while UCLA required extra time in the semifinals. UCLA would redeem their finals loss the previous year and defeat JMU 2–0, claiming their second open title. Isis Piccillo of UCLA would be named MVP.

" El Velorio depicts a traditional 19th-century baquiné or velorio del angelito (""wake of a little angel""), a specific type of wake with origins in Afro-Puerto Rican culture that was celebrated by jibaros and other countrymen as funerary celebrations for the death of a child. This practice originates in the syncretic Catholic and folk belief that the death of an innocent baptized child results in their automatic ascension and entrance into Heaven and that the occasion is therefore a cause not only for remembrance but for celebration. The baquiné in this portrait depicts the deceased child as a focal point dressed in white and adorned with flowers, lying on a table at the center of a traditional countryside house. The iconography of the child, reminiscent of a Christ Child, symbolizes his purity and innocence but also presents a lighter theme that separates the painting into two visual contrasts: one lighter in colors that depicts scenes of joy and celebration with food and music, and another with darker colors and shadows that depicts not only the sorrow of the child's parents but also a chaotic scene of a priest trying to perform wake rites while dogs are running around. This exemplifies the everyday clash between life and death, and between celebration and suffering, common in the life of poor countrymen in 19th-century Puerto Rico. The scene is intentionally portrayed as a judgmental satire, with Francisco Oller himself describing the scene as “an orgy of brutish appetites under the guise of gross superstition."""

" The show had a mixed critical reception, with the acting being praised, but the plotting criticised. In a four-star review of the first four episodes, The Guardian's Luke Buckmaster said that it took him time to ""get accustomed to The Messenger's idiosyncratic rhythms, but soon I relished returning to this world"", noting a ""strange alchemy between setting and character"", with ""lean and uncluttered"" plotting. He praised the directors and screenwriters for ""deftly balanc[ing] comedy and drama, creating a subtle and strange quirkiness"", and for ""trust[ing] in the nature and strength of the story and the cast, allowing scenes to breathe while keeping things progressing at a good pace"", as well as the efforts by the programme's cinematographer to ensure ""retro flavour is baked into the show's aesthetic"". TV Tonight's David Knox, in a three-and-a-half star review of the first two episodes, said the series ""effectively asks you to leave your logic at the door and go with its heightened mix of drama, dark comedy and magic realism"", praising McKenna as a ""likeable lead"", and that the series impressed upon him an attempt by ABC to appeal to younger viewers, doubtful it ""will connect with core ABC viewers, and perhaps it might be best framed as premium YA content"". Mel Campbell, for ScreenHub, was more critical. In a two-and-a-half star review of the first four episodes, she opined that the series ""often seems to deliberately withhold sense-making from the audience in pursuit of its air of mystery"", and found the series flipping between what she saw as ""realist drama or magical realism"", and inconsistent motivations of the characters, as exasperating, yet nevertheless said ""the cast do their best with this flawed material""."

 Imambara Zadibal has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. From the period of Sultan Nazuk Shah by Mirza Douglat in 1548 AD to the reign of Maharaja Ranbir Singh in 1872 AD, this shrine was burnt down around eleven times. At the time Imambara Zadibal was constructed. However, Mirza Hyder Kashgari Douglat set this shrine on fire in 1548 AD. Daulat Chak began rebuilding it in 1551. Zafar Kupawari set Imambara Zadibal on fire for the second time in 1553. It was burned down again in 1653 during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. In 1682 AD, when Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir ruled, Imambara Zadibal was set on fire again. In 1719 AD, it was burned down for the fifth time during the Mukhtawi Khan clash. It caught fire for the sixth time in 1748 AD. Again in 1763. Imambara Zadibal caught fire again in June 1801, during Afghan rule in Kashmir, just before Ashura.In July 1830, the shrine was the site of a massacre when Jammu and Kashmir were under Sikh rule. This same day, many Shias were cruelly murdered. This happened at Ali Park in Zadibal or Margibal. Imambara Zadibal was rebuilt with the financial help sent by Nawab Hakim Mehndi Ali Khan, the prime minister of Awadh's King Nasir-ud-din Haider. This grant was sent to Haji Baqir Khan Irani, who passed on the duty of rebuilding this structure to Hatim Mir. In September 1872, the building was again set ablaze under the rule of Maharaja Ranbir Singh. He was a Dogra Ruler of J&K. This time, the king gave considerable financial aid of about Rs. 3 lakhs to renovate the Imambara and restore it to its current prosperous condition.

" The uprising was subject to intense criticism from Ukrainian left-wing nationalist figures. Mykhailo Hrushevsky, Ukrainian head of state prior to Skoropadskyi's coup d'état, allegedly described it as the ""darkest moment of the Ukrainian revolution."" The left wing of the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party also condemned the uprising as ""counter-revolutionary."" The Ukrainian populace reacted with ambivalence, by this point exhausted after a year of political turmoil, though Petliura faced criticism in non-partisan press organs. The remaining German soldiers in Kyiv, seeking to evacuate after the collapse of the German Empire, were primarily concerned with the continued operation of the Korosten railway station, which would allow them to return to Germany. Converesely, in Bolshevik circles, the uprising was met with support. Prior to the uprising's beginning, Bolsheviks Christian Rakovsky and Dmitry Manuilsky met with the Directorate's leaders, where they agreed to support the Directorate through ceasefire violations and recognition of the Ukrainian People's Republic in return for the legalisation of the Communist Party of Ukraine. These agreements were a tactical move by the Bolsheviks, as part of a broader campaign to weaken Ukrainian nationalists and strengthen the position of communist insurgent groups.

She operated alone on the Gutcher, Yell - Belmont, Unst - Oddsta, Fetlar service until 1988 when she was joined by MV Fylga. Once the two new Yell ferries were introduced in 2004, MV Bigga replaced Fylga on the service. This is the same year that the Fetlar terminal changed from Oddsta to Hamars Ness. Due to a vessel change, on 3 October 2005, Fivla was relegated to the fleet relief vessel, which she still operates as today. Each month she covers a different ro-ro ferry in the fleet so that they can go for their annual refit. She also covers any breakdowns that occur across the fleet. The only rest the ferry gets is when she goes for her own annual refit, normally on the Malakoff slip in Lerwick. On 28 April 2010, while carrying out refit cover in Yell Sound, she was trapped underneath the linkspan in Toft. This was due to four preventer chains on the linkspan snapping simultaneously from the low spring tides and the lower freeboard of the relief vessel. Due to this, during the following days (29 April and 4 May 2010), she operated a special service between Vidlin and Ulsta, Yell. == References ==	MV Fivla was the first ro-ro ferry to be built on the Isle of Lewis and Shetland, and has been in service since 1985.

 The Fifth Circuit analyzed whether Bitcoin transaction records are protected by the Fourth Amendment. The court likened Bitcoin transactions to bank records, which are not protected by the Fourth Amendment under the third-party doctrine. This doctrine holds that a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties. The court ruled that Gratkowski voluntarily disclosed information about his Bitcoin transactions to third parties (i.e., all users globally of the Bitcoin network and Coinbase), and therefore he had no reasonable expectation of privacy in this information. Affirming the district court's denial of Gratkowski's motion to suppress the evidence, the court ruled that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in Bitcoin transaction records on the blockchain or held by a third-party exchange like Coinbase, thus such records are not protected by the Fourth Amendment. The case was decided by a panel consisting of Circuit Judges Carl E. Stewart, James L. Dennis, and Catharina Haynes, with Judge Haynes delivering the opinion of the court.	A computer user who submits data to a server for processing by the server must provide the server with a decryption key in order for the server to process the data.
 Fruit production: Fruit production is a major driver of deforestation around the world. In tropical countries, forests are often cleared to plant fruit trees, such as bananas, pineapples, and mangoes. This deforestation is having a number of negative environmental impacts, including: Biodiversity loss: Forests are home to a wide variety of plant and animal species, many of which are found nowhere else in the world. Deforestation is threatening these species with extinction. Ecosystem disruption: Forests play a vital role in regulating the environment. They help to absorb rainwater, prevent flooding, and mitigate climate change. Deforestation can disrupt these important ecosystem services. Land degradation: When forests are cleared, the soil is often left exposed to erosion. This can lead to land degradation, which can make it difficult to grow crops.

" Andrews returned to his education in 1994. He pursued a PhD in chemistry at Stanford University under the direction of Steven Boxer, which he completed in 2001. His research focused on the effects of electric fields on molecular vibrations, called the vibrational Stark effect, which he investigated with infrared spectroscopy. In the process, he developed a liquid nitrogen immersion cryostat and novel FTIR scanning methods. After earning his PhD, Andrews switched fields to systems biology. This started with post-doctoral research in Dennis Bray's laboratory at the University of Cambridge (2001-2003), where he investigated spatial aspects of cell signaling. As part of this work, he developed a spatially detailed biochemical simulator called Smoldyn, a project that has continued to be a major part of his career. Andrews followed this position with several others: more post-doctoral research in Adam Arkin's laboratory at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (2003-2007), a visiting scientist position at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (2007), a staff scientist position at the Molecular Sciences Institute (2008-2009), a staff scientist position in Roger Brent's laboratory at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (2009-2016), a physics teaching position at Seattle University (2015-2020), and his current scientist position in Herbert Sauro's laboratory at the University of Washington (2020-). Andrews's research has continued to focus on algorithm and software development for spatially detailed biochemical modeling, including particle, filament, and surface dynamics. His software, Smoldyn, is used for biophysics and cell modeling research. Andrews has also worked on non-spatial biochemical models. For example, in work with Roger Brent, he found that symmetric ""push-pull"" reaction mechanisms are able to make biochemical signaling outputs depend linearly on their inputs."

" After the release of X&Y (2005), Coldplay decided to build their own recording studio. Chris Martin commented their former workplace ""felt a little dirty"" and the band ""weren't really speaking to each other. We all had our corner office in a big tower block, but there was no vibe"". Furthermore, they bought an old bakery in 2006 to help them refocus and established it as their headquarters. The building is intercalated between ""an estate agent and tiny restaurant"". Will Champion described it as a ""giant version"" of Jonny Buckland's room in Camden Road, from when the group studied at University College London. Producer Rik Simpson helped them to convert the place into a studio, which has their management offices above it and is ""good for overdubs"", but hard to do ""full band recordings""."

 The result was Selangor's biggest league victory in 87 years. Kelantan has now broken the Malaysian football record with recorded 106 goals conceded in all competitions this season including a record breaking 87 goals conceded in the Super League. On previous results they also lost with a big score to Terengganu with a result of 8–0 in the league match and also Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT) with a result of 10–0 in the cup match. Kelantan head coach Angel Alfredo Vera said that the lack of imported players in his squad was one of the reasons for the team’s crushing big loss defeat to Selangor in their Super League match. He shrugged off the result saying, “We didn’t have players who could dominate this match, especially imported players. The players we have are very young, they don’t have the experience, on average they have only played five Super League matches,” he told the post-match press conference. The outcome was also the worst loss by a home team in Malaysian football history, as the eleventh-goal difference doubled the previous record margin. == References ==	The result was biggest league victory in 87 years.
 Incorporating elements of animation, sculpture, and sound, Nathalie Djurberg and Hans Berg construct scenarios rich in psychological tension, exploring both human and primal desires. Djurberg, since 2001, has cultivated a unique filmmaking style marked by clay animation, through which she articulates fundamental instincts such as jealousy, vengeance, avarice, submission, and lust. Since 2004, Djurberg has been working as an artistic duo with her collaborator, musician and composer Hans Berg, complementing Djurberg's animations and installations with his atmospheric sound effects and entrancing musical scores. Djurberg and Berg frequently construct mentally disconcerting environments in their films and sculptural installations. Their main characters, often depicted as girls or young women, are described by The New York Times as engaging in a spectrum of malevolent activities. These range from mild deceit and amicable torture, to curiously innocuous bestiality, and at the extreme, murder and chaos. == References ==	D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D.

" News of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces. The threat of mutiny was rife. Admiral Reinhard Scheer and Ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the ""valour"" of the German Navy. In northern Germany, the German Revolution of 1918–1919 began at the end of October 1918. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost, initiating the uprising. The sailors' revolt, which then ensued in the naval ports of Wilhelmshaven and Kiel, spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918, shortly thereafter to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and to German surrender."	The Battle of the Somme was one of the bloodiest battles of World War One, fought between Germany and the Allied forces in France and Belgium.
 Nigeria received an RFI emergency loan for economic losses incurred due to COVID-19, which is to be repaid within 5 years, and repayments beginning within the third year. The RFI loan was conditioned upon the nation's adherence to transparency and participation in independent audits of crisis-mitigation. Moreover, Nigeria agreed to publish emergency expenses to ensure the loan was being utilized for its specified purpose. There was a severe drop in international demand and oil prices by 2020, resulting in exports decline of more than US$26 billion.In June 2022, under the leadership of IMF's Mission Chief in Nigeria, Jesmin Rahman, convened several meetings assessing the present condition of the Nigerian economy following COVID-19, the 2020 RFI loan, and the repercussions of the Russia-Ukraine war. In May 2022, inflation grew to 17.7 percent, creating new economic and social concerns, particularly among the over 40 percent of the Nigerian population that live below the poverty line and face severe food insecurity. == References ==	Nigeria received an RFI emergency loan for economic losses incurred due to COVID-19 .

 The AN/PSQ-42 Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular combines two image intensification tubes with an uncooled thermal imager and is able to operate in an I²-only mode or a fusion mode that combines I² with a thermal image overlay. The overlay is also capable of displaying a compass and augmented reality data from a Nett Warrior device. The ENVG-B can also display wirelessly transmitted weapon sight crosshair and thermal imagery from the Family of Weapon Sights-Individual (FWS-I) thermal imager mounted on a weapon. The image-intensifying tubes also allows the user to illuminate, designate, and engage targets conventionally with weapon-mounted infrared laser pointer-illuminator devices such as the AN/PEQ-15. The entire ENVG-B assembly consists of the ENVG-B goggles themselves, Positioning Assembly (PA), Helmet Mount Assembly (HMA) and battery pack. In a fashion similar to the AN/PSQ-20 and AN/PVS-31, the ENVG-B does not receive power from a battery within the goggle housing itself (such as in the AN/PVS-14). Instead, the goggle receives power from the battery pack mounted on the rear of the soldier's helmet via a circuit that traverses the HMA and PA, with hotshoe connectors at the interface between those components. This shifts the center mass of an ENVG-B equipped helmet toward the wearer's neck, resulting in a more ergonomic balance and reducing neck strain, especially in the prone. The ENVG-G assembly can be mounted on the ACH, ECH and IHPS helmets. A special helmet cover designed to conceal the battery pack and HMA exists for the ACH and ECH. A small infrared illuminator is built into the housing for viewing handheld items like a map, weapon, or radio. A gain control knob is centrally mounted on the bridge of the goggle housing. Both the eyepieces and objective lenses are capable of affixing a protective sacrificial lens, and the objective lenses have removable protective rubber caps with lanyards.	An enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular has been unveiled by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) for the first time.
" The game consists of four quadrants: four players choose their own squares; begins with the 4th square diagonally serving to the 2nd square; the 2nd then returns the ball with one hit to any square to start the rally. When the ball lands in a player’s square they are eliminated, and the player in the 4th square always scores a point but only if the player in the 4th square is not eliminated (otherwise, no points are received by any); the remaining three players all rotate clockwise, and the eliminated player keeps their points but goes back to the 1st square OR is replaced by a new player in the 1st square. The game is played to 11 points (win by 2). A player is eliminated when: the ball lands on the ground inside their own square; player returns the ball out of bounds; failing to hit the ball into another square; double hitting the ball; hitting the ball incorrectly; or hitting the ball out of turn. The ball is considered in play when the ball lands on the outside boundary. Players are not allowed to catch, hold, or carry the ball at any point during play. Players are required to hit the ball with their ""hands"", which is any section between the fingertips and wrists, including the back of the hands."	The game of rally is played by four players on a court in a straight line, with the ball being hit from one side of the court to the other.

" The undeclared war between the United Kingdom and Argentina in April 1982 posed a problem for the editorial staff of Battle. While the British response to what was viewed as an invasion of British territory produced a boom in patriotism and interest in warfare, Battle editor Terry Magee, boys' adventure group editor Barrie Tomlinson and managing editor John Sanders ultimately agreed that 'cashing in' on the conflict would be in poor taste. As it was, the fighting concluded on 14 June 1982 and IPC swiftly planned coverage. To maintain decorum over a conflict which had seen 255 British deaths, it was decided to make a documentary-style strip simply recounting the events with no overt fictional elements. Battle co-creator and frequent contributor John Wagner was eager to write the strip, recalling he was ""ready to go"" and ""was all for bashing the Argies"" at the time. Stalwart Jim Watson drew the comic."	This is a documentary-style strip simply recounting the events with no overt fictionalism.
 In the men's championship division finals, the 2000 champions, Penn State, would face North Carolina in their national finals debut. While all of Penn State's previous 5 games were within a goal, North Carolina would cut it much closer, requiring extra time in their previous two games, including a nine-round penalty shootout with Illinois in the semifinals. Despite playing nearly 30 extra minutes, North Carolina started early with a goal from Eric Rossitch in the 5th minute off of a header near the 6-yard box off of a free kick. A goal in the last minute by Daniel Goff while Penn State had all 11 men in North Carolina's half would see North Carolina win 2–0. This was North Carolina's first national title and the first national title by a Region II team, the only region who hadn't had a team claim a men's championship national title. In the women's championship finals, the 2012 champions, Michigan State, would face Colorado State who were looking on claiming their fourth national title. Both teams required extra time in the semifinals and Colorado State further needed penalty kicks to decide not only the semifinals, but also the quarterfinals. Following the trend for both teams, the game would remain 0-0 after 80 minutes, meaning extra time would be required. Four minutes into extra time, eventual MVP Danielle Manning of Michigan State would break the deadlock with a sudden-victory goal that gave Michigan State their second women's national title. Both of Michigan State's titles were won in extra time. In the men's open finals, Oregon would return to the open finals after their title 10 years ago in 2005 to face UC-Davis who were making their debut. Coming in, Oregon won each of their previous 5 games by at least 2 goals while UC-Davis had only given up a single goal. UC-Davis would go up 2–1 in the match, but Oregon's Henry Fassinger would score a penalty kick late into the game to tie the game at 2-2, forcing the game into extra time. Eventual MVP, Andrew Saenz of Oregon, would score a sudden-victory goal to secure Oregon's 3–2 win and their second national title.In the women's open finals, 2012 open champions, JMU, would face last year's open runners-up UCLA. Coming in, JMU would require a penalty shootout in the quarterfinals while UCLA required extra time in the semifinals. UCLA would redeem their finals loss the previous year and defeat JMU 2–0, claiming their second open title. Isis Piccillo of UCLA would be named MVP.	The finals of the US Women's World Cup have been announced on Saturday. Here are the key points for the teams in the game.

 The poem begins with Claudian recounting the career of Eutropius, an Eastern Roman politician and court eunuch, who became highly influential in the court of the empire who was highly influential in the Imperial court. Claudian claims that Eutropius spent his early years as a catamite, which was a type of prepubescent male companion in a pederastic relationship in ancient Rome. According to Claudian, Eutropius went on to become a pimp, and a lady's maid, before being freed of slavery out of disgust. Claudian then discusses his ascent to power, then describes his actions as a ruler, and portrays him as a cruel and corrupt ruler, then his campaign into Armenia, and then his rise to the position of consul. Claudian wrote that while the senate in Constantinople approved of his rise to consul, the rest of the Roman world found it to be distasteful. According to Claudian, the goddess Roma then begs the Western Emperor Honorius and his general Stilicho to prevent the same fate from occurring in the Western empire. Following this, due to their disgust at Eutropius, the god Mars and his sister Bellona incite the Greuthungi into revolt against Eutropius. After failing to bribe the rebels, Claudian describes Eutropius turning to his general Leo to end the revolt. Leo's expedition ends in a military disaster. Following this, the goddess Aurora goes to seek Stilicho, appealing to him to intervene and save the Eastern empire.

 After gaining independence from the Netherlands, Indonesia claimed all Dutch colonial territories of the Malay Archipelago, including West Papua (formerly Dutch New Guinea). Following a controversial referendum known as the Act of Free Choice, the Papua conflict began as separatists from the Free Papua Movement (OPM) and West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) have conducted a low-intensity guerrilla war against the Indonesian forces, while Indonesia has been accused of conducting a genocidal camphaign against the local indigenous tribes. On 8 September 2021, members of the TPNPB burnt machinery used for the construction of the Trans-Papua Highway. 5 days later, riots broke out in Kiwirok when members of the TPNPB attacked public buildings, including a school and a medical centre, injuring nine people, one of whom later died. This incident was quite unusual for Kiwirok as TPNPB attacks have usually focused on other areas such as Oksibil. As a result, Indonesia has strengthened their military presence in Kiwirok, further intensifying the conflict. This included carrying out several raids during the months of September and October, in which Indonesian security forces took villagers' belongings, and in extreme cases, killed their livestock and even removed roofing from their homes.	Indonesia has been accused of carrying out a genocide against indigenous tribes in West Papua, which has killed at least nine people.
" Clark spent over a decade in print journalism, including a stint as Sports Assignment Editor for USA Today. While filling that role, Clark says he pushed for better media coverage of bowling, feeling that the media ""never treated bowling fairly."" As industry insiders read and responded to Clark's articles, it led to his first job in the bowling business as Chief Marketing Officer for the United States Bowling Congress (USBC) in 2005. In April 2008, he was hired as Deputy Commissioner of the PBA, working under then-Commissioner and CEO Fred Schreyer. Clark's time as Deputy Commissioner coincided with the collapse of the U.S. financial industry in 2008 and 2009. Faced with financial issues, the PBA and ESPN jointly worked on ways to cut costs. One idea was to hold multiple tournaments in one location which could have the final rounds recorded and aired at a later date, thus saving on talent and crew travel costs. It also reduced the travel costs for PBA players, who are essentially independent contractors that take care of their own travel expenses. The result was the very first PBA World Series of Bowling, which Clark takes credit for creating, held August-September 2009 in Allen Park, Michigan. The World Series of Bowling continues through the present, and held its 14th annual event in 2023."

 For more than half a century, Zhang made her home in Xi’an, Shaan’xi Province. Her works focus on the unity and harmonious relationship between science and aesthetics, as well as between vernacular and modern. In the 1970s, she undertook the restoration of building structures and gardens of the Tang dynasty. Her ideas on utilising technological and scientific advancements were realised in her conservation and heritage projects, most notably the Shaanxi History Museum. The project is described as a modern architectural project by which traditional architectural elements are used as ingredients of innovation. Beyond revitalising the ancient city and its history, Zhang’s designs present architecture features of the past in the modern context. This approach, often referred as the “Neo-Tang Style”, gained popularity through her works.	Zhang made her home in Xi’an, Shaan’xi Province, for more than half a century .

 Maurice-Mollard Plaza features a monumental, flower-filled fountain at its center, raised on porphyry paving stones. The northern part of the square is embellished with tree-lined avenues, bordering Les Thermes Plaza and the Square du Temple de Diane d'Aix-les-Bains. A grassy area planted with trees and flowers occupies the southern part of the square, in the middle of which stands a staircase giving access to Lord-Revelstoke Avenue (D913). Here, you'll find the Hôtel de Ville square, located above the entrance to the underground parking lot. Several historic monuments are located on and near the square: The Aix-les-Bains town hall, resulting from the redevelopment of a 16th-century château, has been listed as a historic monument since August 7th, 1890 for its staircase, and since December 11th, 1982 for the entire building apart from the north wing. The Temple of Diane in Aix-les-Bains, adjoining the town hall to the northwest, is one of only three classical-style Roman temples to have been completely preserved in France, alongside the Maison Carrée in Nîmes and the Temple of Augustus and Livia in Vienne, and has been listed as a historic monument since 1875. The former national thermal baths of Aix-les-Bains have an entrance on the Maurice-Mollard Plaza side leading to the 913 departmental road. The building has been listed as a historic monument since April 24th, 1986. The Arch of Campanus, a Roman monument dating from the 1st century B.C., has been listed since August 7th, 1890.

 A 110 km (68 mi) track from Koderma to Maheshmunda was constructed. This extended the Madhupur–Giridih railway line to Koderma, effectively making it a Madhupur–Giridih–Koderma line. A new station was built on Maheshmunda–Koderma section named as New Giridih (NGRH) which leaves out the already existing station Giridih (GRD) on this route, also making Maheshmunda a junction station. On 16 February 2019, Eastern Railway in its press-release announced a passenger train service w.e.f. 25 February 2019 from Koderma to Madhupur via New Giridih.	The eastern railway line between Madhupur and Koderma in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh was built in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
 Digging of the shaft began on June 1, 1854, 835 metres from the Saint-Charles shaft, with a section measuring 5.1 metres by 2.5 metres. By September 1856, it had reached a depth of 93.60 metres. The water was drained (20 m3 per hour) using a ten-horsepower steam engine consisting of a horizontal cylinder and gears. This engine was used to drive the pumps and raise the skips of excavated material, while a horse-drawn engine was used to lower the equipment and carry out various manoeuvres. A casing was installed in the rectangular section. At 25.70 metres, the shaft was circular in cross-section and 3.20 metres in diameter. In September 1856, a 12-horsepower direct-drive steam engine accompanied by pumps was ordered from Le Creusot for dewatering; this equipment was operational in June 1857 and sinking resumed. The dewatering machine operated at a rate of seven or eight strokes per minute, but was capable of twelve strokes per minute if necessary. The water was pumped up through sheet metal pipes 24 centimetres in diameter.In May 1858, the installation of the dodecagonal casing, made up of sides 94 centimetres wide and a total height of 98.50 metres, was completed. However, the casing was fragile and eventually began to leak, so a small pump driven by a four-horsepower steam engine was installed 104 metres above the surface in June 1873. It collected between 100 and 120 m3 of water a day in a cofferdam.

 After gaining independence from the Netherlands, Indonesia claimed all Dutch colonial territories of the Malay Archipelago, including West Papua (formerly Dutch New Guinea). Following a controversial referendum known as the Act of Free Choice, the Papua conflict began as separatists from the Free Papua Movement (OPM) and West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) have conducted a low-intensity guerrilla war against the Indonesian forces, while Indonesia has been accused of conducting a genocidal camphaign against the local indigenous tribes. On 8 September 2021, members of the TPNPB burnt machinery used for the construction of the Trans-Papua Highway. 5 days later, riots broke out in Kiwirok when members of the TPNPB attacked public buildings, including a school and a medical centre, injuring nine people, one of whom later died. This incident was quite unusual for Kiwirok as TPNPB attacks have usually focused on other areas such as Oksibil. As a result, Indonesia has strengthened their military presence in Kiwirok, further intensifying the conflict. This included carrying out several raids during the months of September and October, in which Indonesian security forces took villagers' belongings, and in extreme cases, killed their livestock and even removed roofing from their homes.

 In 1954, musician Ike Turner relocated his band the Kings of Rhythm from Clarksdale, Mississippi to St. Louis, Missouri. Turner performed around the greater St. Louis area and built a strong following. In 1957, Ann Bullock joined Turner's band as a vocalist and was called Little Ann. She was later given the stage name Tina Turner and they released their first song as Ike & Tina Turner in 1960. When the single became a hit, they began performing as the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. They embarked on a grueling series of one-nighters throughout the United States on the Chitlin' Circuit. They relocated to Los Angeles, California in 1962. In 1966, the Turners visited England for the first time to join the Rolling Stones on their British Tour. In 1969, they began headlining in Las Vegas, Nevada. They gained further exposure by performing at music festivals and joining the Rolling Stones for select dates on their American Tour. The revue continued to expand its audience by performing in Africa, Asia, and throughout Europe until they disbanded in 1976.

 In 2016, Garcia founded the party called Prodinculous/Procitizen advocating for the protection of entrepreneurial freedom and the preservation of individuals' rights to private ownership. Garcias has voiced his belief as the surveys indicate that Venezuelans are in favor of Free Enterprise, economic freedom, dialogue, and women's rights. He was disqualified from running for the mayor of Caracas, a decision he publicly denounced. In 2019, he traveled to the United States and met with Mauriceo Clever and various officials in the Donald Trump administration. During this time, he emphasized the need for a unity government between the opposition and the Chavista government as the solution for Venezuela's political problems. Ten deputies who were previously members of the parliamentary block of the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) in the National Assembly (AN) from Un Nuevo Tiempo and other parties resigned from their parties and joined García's political movement.

 The sculpture consist of two sphinxes, with the left missing its head. Found in fragments initially, the stele was broken from side to side, along with the forelegs, which were subsequently repaired. The lower portion is decorated with a frieze of palmettes, egg, and dart, characteristic of 5th century BC style, with portions of the stele maintaining its original polychromy with red-brown pigment. Both sphinxes are faced back to back, gazing out in three-quarters perspective. The intact sphinx has its hair intact and long, pulled back on the sides, but covering her ears, and wears a crown consisting of circles and merlons, the back of the stele is roughed out with its bottom half broken off. The sphinx motif on the stele indicates it's prominence in cult objects, as prior to the stele's approximate creation, in the mid 5th century BC, the depiction was also seen in the Amathus sarcophagus, considered the most significant object in the Cesnola collection alongside the stele, famous for its preserved polychromy. == References ==	The sculpture consists of two sphinxes, with the left missing its head .

 The Alvars (Tamil: ஆழ்வார், romanized: Āḻvār, lit. 'The Immersed') were the Tamil poet-saints of South India who espoused bhakti (devotion) to the Hindu deity Maha Vishnu, in their songs of longing, ecstasy, and service. They are venerated in Vaishnavism, which regards Vishnu as the Ultimate Reality. The devotional outpourings of the Alvars, composed during the early medieval period of Tamil history, were the catalysts behind the Bhakti Movement through their hymns of worship to Vishnu and his avatars. They praised the Divya Desams, the 108 divine realms of deities affiliated to Vaishnavism. The poetry of the Alvars echoes bhakti to God through love, and in the ecstasy of such devotions they sang hundreds of songs which embodied both depth of feeling and the felicity of expressions. The collection of their hymns is known as the Naalayira Divya Prabandham. The bhakti literature that sprang from Alvars has contributed to the establishment and sustenance of a culture that deviated from the Vedic religion and rooted itself in devotion as the only path for salvation. In addition, they contributed to Tamil devotional verses independent of a knowledge of Sanskrit.

 Henry Ross, who is believed to be the designer of the Eureka Flag, was from Toronto, Canada. The Swiss-born Charles Doudiet, whose sketchbook is held by the Art Gallery of Ballarat and contains such scenes from around the time of the armed uprising as the iconic Eureka Slaughter, had lived in Canada. Doudiet may have been present at the battle, and he notes in his sketchbook that he helped to convey his friend, the mortally wounded Ross, to the Free Trade Hotel, where the Eureka flag bearer died of a groin injury two days later. Robert Julien died defending the stockade, as did Thomas Budden, also a friend of Ross, both from Canada.	A sketchbook by a Canadian artist has been released to mark the centenary of the Battle of Eureka, which ended in January.

" The show had a mixed critical reception, with the acting being praised, but the plotting criticised. In a four-star review of the first four episodes, The Guardian's Luke Buckmaster said that it took him time to ""get accustomed to The Messenger's idiosyncratic rhythms, but soon I relished returning to this world"", noting a ""strange alchemy between setting and character"", with ""lean and uncluttered"" plotting. He praised the directors and screenwriters for ""deftly balanc[ing] comedy and drama, creating a subtle and strange quirkiness"", and for ""trust[ing] in the nature and strength of the story and the cast, allowing scenes to breathe while keeping things progressing at a good pace"", as well as the efforts by the programme's cinematographer to ensure ""retro flavour is baked into the show's aesthetic"". TV Tonight's David Knox, in a three-and-a-half star review of the first two episodes, said the series ""effectively asks you to leave your logic at the door and go with its heightened mix of drama, dark comedy and magic realism"", praising McKenna as a ""likeable lead"", and that the series impressed upon him an attempt by ABC to appeal to younger viewers, doubtful it ""will connect with core ABC viewers, and perhaps it might be best framed as premium YA content"". Mel Campbell, for ScreenHub, was more critical. In a two-and-a-half star review of the first four episodes, she opined that the series ""often seems to deliberately withhold sense-making from the audience in pursuit of its air of mystery"", and found the series flipping between what she saw as ""realist drama or magical realism"", and inconsistent motivations of the characters, as exasperating, yet nevertheless said ""the cast do their best with this flawed material""."

 This dish lends itself to many variations and is sometimes confused with Syracuse sauce (because of the presence of anchovies), the original recipe of which, however, often uses short pasta and does not involve the use of breadcrumbs, but rather a generous amount of vegetables, capers and olives; these are foods that are not present in the traditional recipe of this dish, with the rare exception of olives, which are black. It should also not be confused with the first course, especially in Palermo, called pasta with sardines: although tradition says it was born in the Syracuse area (but by cooks of the Arab army, camped there to conquer the city), it is quite distant from the culinary customs of the Syracuse area, considering ingredients such as raisins and pine nuts (a classic combination of Palermo cuisine), as well as saffron, and the fish that dominates the dish is sardine, not anchovy. The toasted breadcrumbs in the original pasta with sardines are not present.

" The mining companies that were involved, and most prominent in the Vancouver Islands at the time, were: The Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Limited, the Western Fuel of San Francisco, the Pacific Coast Collieries, and the Nanaimo Coal Company. The Canadian Collieries were based in Cumberland and Extension. Owned by the Dunsmuir family, the company played a significant role in the strike by firing a union leader with the last name ""Mottishaw"". This was one of the strike's leading causes. The Western Fuel of San Francisco was based in Nanaimo and owned many of the mines there. The Pacific Coast Collieries only had minor involvement, and were located in South Wellington. The Nanaimo Coal Company stands apart from the other three, as it was the sole company to ""sign an agreement with the union. ""These mining companies (excluding the Nanaimo Coal Company) were opposed to the unions, because they were a threat to the coal companies' power and authority. They coal companies were also dealing with the competition of fuel oil. Because of the potential replacement of coal as fuel with oil as fuel, they worked the miners extra hard and with less pay. This was in an effort to keep up with fuel oil and to stay in business. They needed to pay workers less in order to make a profit. However, unions demanded more pay, causing an issue for the coal companies. They did not want to increase the miners' pay, at the risk of losing their business, and of the entire coal mining industry being replaced by an alternate fuel source. They also had the support of the government, because the economy was so dependent upon the coal industry."	Mining companies in the Vancouver Islands were involved in the strike.

 The minority stress model takes into account significant stressors that distinctly affect the mental health of those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or another non-conforming gender identity. Some risk factors that contribute to declining mental health are heteronormativity, discrimination, harassment, rejection (e.g., family rejection and social exclusion), stigma, prejudice, denial of civil and human rights, lack of access to mental health resources, lack of access to gender-affirming spaces (e.g., gender-appropriate facilities), and internalized homophobia. The structural circumstance where a non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming individual is embedded in significantly affects the potential sources of risk. The compounding of these everyday stressors increase poor mental health outcomes among individuals in the LGBT community. Evidence shows that there is a direct association between LGBT individuals' development of severe mental illnesses and the exposure to discrimination.In addition, there are a lack of access to mental health resources specific to LGBT individuals and a lack of awareness about mental health conditions within the LGBT community that restricts patients from seeking help.	The minority stress model is a key model for the LGBT community in the UK, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).
 The slow transition from small foraging and hunter/gathering groups to more advanced agricultural societies began four to six thousand years ago in the Amazon Basin, with the exact timing varying by sub-region. These more advanced farming systems involved intensive arboriculture as well as staple root and seed crops that supported stable settlements with relatively large populations. Reports by early European explorers described large “well-fed populations along the bluffs, surrounded by orchards on the uplands and seasonal fields in the floodplains.” As elsewhere in the Americas, the European conquest brought the collapse of indigenous populations and their advanced agricultural systems were largely forgotten. Starting in roughly the year 2000, formal research projects (using molecular data, microfossil botanical techniques, remote sensing, and plant genetics) have resurrected the story of human settlement of the Amazon Basin – it is no longer thought to have been a primeval forest at the time of European contact and can now be considered, along with Mesoamerica, as an “early and independent cradle of agriculture”.The principal features of these agricultural practices are as follows:	The story of human settlements in the Amazon Basin has been rediscovered by scientists using remote genetics.
" Some time in the late 1990s or early 2000s, Johnny Science chose to go ""stealth"" - that is, to pull away from FTM activism and blend in with the cisgender gay male community. His friends regularly told him of the goings-on in the trans community, and he expressed sadness over feeling like he could not both participate and be accepted as a man by wider society. Science found a new home in gay kink communities, becoming both a member of the Gay Male S&M Activists and the Metro NY Chapter president of the National Leather Association. In the mid-1990s, Science founded The Jovian Gentlemen, a social club for older men and younger men who wanted to date each other. Many events hosted by The Jovian Gentlemen were kinky play parties. Science preserved hundreds of documents, videos, sound files, and other ephemera pertaining to his and other peoples' LGBT activism in both print and digital form in his home.Johnny Science was in ill health for the last ten years of his life. He died of heart failure in 2007 and was given an extensive obituary in issue #114 of Transgender Tapestry. The ephemera he preserved were donated to New York University after he died. In 2019, some ephemera collected by Johnny Science was displayed at NYU's Bobst Library in an exhibition entitled ""Violet Holdings: LGBTQ+ Highlights from the NYU Special Collections."""	In the early 1990s, Johnny Science was a prominent member of the trans community, and was involved in a number of projects aimed at improving the lives of transgender people.

He went under the party Nishinomiya Restoration Party, and with 11,291 votes, Nonomura was elected as an assemblymember. As an assemblymember, he was active as a nonpartisan politician. On June 30, 2014, the Kobe Shimbun reported that Nonomura spent 5.64 million yen on political activity expenses during the 2013 fiscal year, exceeding the average of 5.22 million yen spent by most assemblymembers, which included multiple trips to an onsen in Toyooka as well as multiple trips to Sayō. It was later determined that it would be impossible for Nonomura to attend all trips, with Nonomura's private schedules having no indication of multiple trips.	Hiroshi Nonomura, the former Mayor of Taishi, Japan's northern province of Osaka, has been elected as a politician.
" Addressing feudalism would necessitate a distinct kind of association with England. Historically, the fidelity of the local lords played a pivotal role in the Channel Islands' choice to remain under the English monarch. Central to this intricate relationship is the practice and importance of fiefs, deeply ingrained in Norman tradition. In Normandy, and subsequently in the Channel Islands, fiefs were deemed of utmost significance, as eloquently described in the Coutume de Normandie (the legal customs of Normandy): ""Je ne sais pas quelles sont ces dignités qui peuvent être possédés sans fond ni glebe, et pour lesquelles on doit hommage et non relief, à la réserve de certaines sargenteries qui n'ont point de glebe. Ces fiefs en l'air sont fiefs impropres; proprie enim feudum in rebus soli constitit.""transl. ""I do not know what these dignities are that can be held without foundation or glebe, and for which homage is due and not relief, except for certain sargenteries that have no glebe. These floating fiefs are improper fiefs; for a proper fief rests on tangible assets."" The Coutume elucidates the divergence between Norman and English practices: ""(en Normandie) on n'en use pas comme en Angleterre, où les dignités des Ducs & Comtes ne sont pas attachées aux fiefs. Ce sont des dignités personnelles que le ROI donne à qui lui plaît, et tel s'appelle Duc & comte de Warwick, de Northumberland... mais même n'y a rien du tout.""transl. ""(In Normandy) they do not operate as they do in England, where the titles of Dukes & Counts aren't tethered to fiefs. These are personal titles bestowed by the KING at his discretion, and someone might be named Duke & Count of Warwick, Northumberland... yet they don't hold any tangible property."" This distinction rests upon the inherent value placed on possessing glebe (landed estates) in the Channel Islands. While firmly rooted in Norman traditions, it contrasts sharply with the English approach. The Channel Islands' feudal tradition is commonly recognized as one of the unique characteristics that distinguish the islands and grants them a special status. As C. Northcote Parkinson once remarked: ""Without its feudalism, Guernsey as a tourist resort would be little different from Bognor Regis."""	Historically, the fidelity of the local lords played a pivotal role in the Channel Islands' choice to remain under the English monarch . Central to this intricate relationship is the practice and importance of fiefs, deeply ingrained in Norman tradition .
 In such conditions, the Seimas of Transcaucasia, at the request of the Abkhazian People's Council, made a decision to restore order in Abkhazia. The chief of staff of the People's Guard, Valiko Jugheli, was appointed as the head of the operation, and General Giorgi Mazniashvili, who at that time was fighting against the Ottoman Empire on the Choloki-Nataneb front, was assigned to separate a detachment to fight against the Bolsheviks in Abkhazia. Colonel Alexander Koniashvili and Alexander Dgebuadze went to Abkhazia together with Valiko Jugheli. Abkhaz princes offered help to the People's Guard, according to one version, it was Tatash Marshania and his squad with 300 horsemen.	At the end of World War I, Abkhazia was under the control of the Bolsheviks, who had seized power in the country in 1917.
 In 1950 Washington H. Soul Pattinson and Co. Ltd. bought the pharmacy business known as Edmond Samuels Pty. Ltd. Samuels retired to a house he built, in the then mostly rural suburb of Castle Hill, with his companion Joseph Smith. At the same time Patrick White, and his partner Manoly Lascaris, lived on acreage in the same area. In his death notice in 1973, Samuels was listed in the Sydney Morning Herald as formerly residing in Potts Point. He was survived by his nephew Gordon Samuels. Gordon Jacob Samuels served as the 36th Governor of New South Wales having been a Judge of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, Chancellor of the University of New South Wales and Chairman of the Law Reform Commission of New South Wales. His wife was the actor Dr Jacqueline Samuels (who was known by the stage name of Jacqueline Knott) continuing the Samuels family tradition of involvement in the theatre. == References ==	A family tradition of involvement in the theatre.

 The competition consisted of 80 teams: 48 championship division teams and 32 open division teams. Each of these divisions were further divided into two equal sized divisions for men and women. The championship division divided teams into eight groups of three teams each while the open division divided teams into four groups of four teams each, both engaging in a round-robin tournament that determined teams able to advance to a knockout stage. Pool play games were two 40-minute halves, separated by a seven-minute halftime and utilized the three points for a win system. After group stage play, the two highest ranked teams from each group advanced to their respective knockout stage. In the championship division, the third placed team advanced to a consolation bracket while in the open division, the third and fourth placed teams were eliminated. Knockout stage games also consisted of two 40-minute halves. The round of 16 and quarterfinals were separated by a seven-minute halftime while the semifinals and finals had a ten-minute halftime. Knockout stage games needed to declare a winner, therefore if a game was tied at the end of regulation, one 15-minute, golden-goal overtime period would begin. If still tied after overtime, kicks from the mark would determine the winner.	The 2015 Women's EuroHockey Championship was the first time the competition was held in the United States and was won by the United Arab Emirates.
" The story was one of several Crisis stories to be rapidly repackaged as a graphic novel, an unusual step for British comics of the time. Rian Hughes, art director for Crisis, handled the design, which included a new cover commissioned from Pleece and a foreword by Grant Morrison. At this stage the story began attracting negative attention from Christian groups, and The Sunday Times ran an interview with Dave Roberts (then-editor of Christian magazine Alpha), describing it as ""an incitement to religious hatred"" and comparing it to Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses as an example of blasphemy. Fleetway's managing director John Davidge, who had controversially blocked Crisis from publishing Peter Milligan and Brendan McCarthy's ""Skin"", ordered the collected edition withdrawn after a short period on sale; a press release stated this was due to the story being ""inappropriate"" for the book market. Purportedly Davidge made the decision on the direct order of Fleetway owner Robert Maxwell. The print run - variously reported as being 5,000 or 20,000 copies - was destroyed. The Economist ran an article on the controversy on 19 January 1991, speculating that ""no one would think twice about it"" if the story was a novel, and felt that the furore was largely caused by the ongoing belief in the press that the comic medium was still exclusively aimed at children. New Statesman also discussed the controversy, quoting a BBC Radio 4 interview where Ennis reiterated his opposition to organised religion. In 1997 DC's mature readers Vertigo Comics label, for whom Ennis was writing Preacher at the time, released a new collected edition with a fresh cover by Pleece and a ne foreword by Ennis himself."	This story was one of several stories to be rapidly rapidly repackaged as a graphic novel, an unusual step for comics of the time.
 Under a certain number of visitors, the marginal cost of an additional visitor is negligible compared to the cost of preserving the collection. Thus, asking each visitor to pay an amount corresponding to the average cost of the museum would exclude many potential visitors with a low willingness to pay for an additional visit. As a result, most museums have a pricing policy based on price discrimination between occasional visitors, who often have a high willingness to pay (if a visit to the museum is an essential part of a holiday in the city concerned, for example), and potentially more regular visitors, whose number of visits depends on the cost of the additional visit. In most cases, this policy takes the form of a two-part tariff structure, with a single ticket on the one hand, and a subscription offering unlimited access to all or part of the museum's collections on the other. In addition to income from admission, museums have long been dependent on either the public authorities or wealthy patrons to finance part of their operating costs. Since the mid-1980s, budgetary stringency has reduced public subsidies, while museum costs have risen as a result of both the increasing sophistication of preservation techniques and the sheer cost of building maintenance. At the same time, sponsorship is increasingly focused on operations (building construction, performances, temporary exhibitions) that provide a showcase. As a result, museums relying essentially on their own resources have increasingly turned to modest and numerous donations, in return for a policy of openness to as many people as possible.	Museums have long been dependent on wealthy patrons to finance part of their operating costs, according to a new report.
" The Marble Palace is open to the public and tourists two days a year: January 16 and January 17. These two days are nationally recognized as ""the days of the martyrs"" and are dedicated to the memory of two martyrs. The first martyr is Patrice Émery Lumumba, who was assassinated in Lubumbashi on January 17, 1961. The second martyr is Laurent-Désiré Kabila, who was assassinated at the Marble Palace on January 16, 2001. The Palace has been carefully preserved, including the bloodstained chair. Parenthetically, the palace displays a collection of photographs documenting Laurent-Désiré Kabila's political struggle, from his time in the maquis to his eventual seizure of power on May 17, 1997. There are also various works of art created in honor of his legacy.

 After gaining independence from the Netherlands, Indonesia claimed all Dutch colonial territories of the Malay Archipelago, including West Papua (formerly Dutch New Guinea). Following a controversial referendum known as the Act of Free Choice, the Papua conflict began as separatists from the Free Papua Movement (OPM) and West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) have conducted a low-intensity guerrilla war against the Indonesian forces, while Indonesia has been accused of conducting a genocidal camphaign against the local indigenous tribes. On 8 September 2021, members of the TPNPB burnt machinery used for the construction of the Trans-Papua Highway. 5 days later, riots broke out in Kiwirok when members of the TPNPB attacked public buildings, including a school and a medical centre, injuring nine people, one of whom later died. This incident was quite unusual for Kiwirok as TPNPB attacks have usually focused on other areas such as Oksibil. As a result, Indonesia has strengthened their military presence in Kiwirok, further intensifying the conflict. This included carrying out several raids during the months of September and October, in which Indonesian security forces took villagers' belongings, and in extreme cases, killed their livestock and even removed roofing from their homes.	The conflict in Papua (formerly Dutch New Guinea) has lasted for more than 50 years and has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people.
 According to legend, seeds of cannabis were brought to Naogaon District for cultivation from Jessore District before 1857 and were first planted. However, according to history, after the establishment of a cannabis hub in Naogaon, Bengal Presidency in 1906, the government of the British Raj started the first commercial cultivation of cannabis in the region Bengal. The government then appointed a registrar to collect revenue from the hub. In 1917, a cooperative society named the Ganja Society was established for the welfare of the 7,000 cannabis growers of Naogaon. The shares of the co-operative society were then sold to the farmers at the rate of ten rupees each, whereby the farmers became its partners. A warehouse was built there to store the produced cannabis. It was inaugurated in 1921 by Syed Nawab Ali Chowdhury, one of the provincial ministers of Bengal. In 1974, the government of Bangladesh signed the Geneva Conventions, which forced the government to withdraw from cannabis production. In 1975, the Ganja Society set up a 1,000 metric ton capacity cold storage facility with three chambers. According to the agreement, the activities of the Ganja Society came to a standstill in 1987 when the cultivation of cannabis was banned. After the ban was announced, the government locked up the Ganja Society's warehouses with manufactured cannabis.

 Fruit production: Fruit production is a major driver of deforestation around the world. In tropical countries, forests are often cleared to plant fruit trees, such as bananas, pineapples, and mangoes. This deforestation is having a number of negative environmental impacts, including: Biodiversity loss: Forests are home to a wide variety of plant and animal species, many of which are found nowhere else in the world. Deforestation is threatening these species with extinction. Ecosystem disruption: Forests play a vital role in regulating the environment. They help to absorb rainwater, prevent flooding, and mitigate climate change. Deforestation can disrupt these important ecosystem services. Land degradation: When forests are cleared, the soil is often left exposed to erosion. This can lead to land degradation, which can make it difficult to grow crops.

 As early as 1911, the game was being played regularly at Oxford with records of the university's Australian rules football club's foundation dating to 1906. The Cambridge University Australian Rules Football Club is believed to have been founded around 1911. In 1911 Oxford University captained by Alfred Clemens defeated Cambridge University captained by Ron Larking 13.9 (87) to 5.12 (42). In 1914, H C A Harrison reported that the game was being played regularly at both Oxford and Cambridge universities though few records exist of contests between 1911 and 1921. After the war, in 1921, the Oxford University–Cambridge University Varsity match between expatriate Australian students became an annual contest. The 90th Varsity match was the subject of a short ABC documentary (Video on YouTube).	Cambridge University Australian Rules Football Club is believed to have been founded around 1911.

 The Alvars (Tamil: ஆழ்வார், romanized: Āḻvār, lit. 'The Immersed') were the Tamil poet-saints of South India who espoused bhakti (devotion) to the Hindu deity Maha Vishnu, in their songs of longing, ecstasy, and service. They are venerated in Vaishnavism, which regards Vishnu as the Ultimate Reality. The devotional outpourings of the Alvars, composed during the early medieval period of Tamil history, were the catalysts behind the Bhakti Movement through their hymns of worship to Vishnu and his avatars. They praised the Divya Desams, the 108 divine realms of deities affiliated to Vaishnavism. The poetry of the Alvars echoes bhakti to God through love, and in the ecstasy of such devotions they sang hundreds of songs which embodied both depth of feeling and the felicity of expressions. The collection of their hymns is known as the Naalayira Divya Prabandham. The bhakti literature that sprang from Alvars has contributed to the establishment and sustenance of a culture that deviated from the Vedic religion and rooted itself in devotion as the only path for salvation. In addition, they contributed to Tamil devotional verses independent of a knowledge of Sanskrit.	A method of worship and service in which the catalysts are the catalysts through their hymns of worship and his avatars.
" Compared to Southeastern China, the Dongbei or Northeast region of China was settled by Han Chinese relatively recently, only in the past 200 years or so, during a migration movement referred to as Chuang Guandong. Jia Xingjia, a Chinese essayist, compared this expansion to the Western Expansion of the United States, in which the Northeast was seen by China as a sort of cultural blank slate. Many of these migrants abandoned their hometowns and left behind their folk traditions and languages. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Northeast was an industrial hotbed of China. State-owned industrial operations guaranteed lifetime employment to blue-collar workers, the ""iron rice bowl."" During this time, it was the most urbanized area of China, and boasted the country's most extensive rail network. Communities were organized around factories which provided not just employment, but also a community to their workers, such as in state-owned cultural palaces, which could serve as movie theaters, libraries, chess rooms, and stadiums, among other roles. These palaces and their decline are a common element of Dongbei renaissance works, and could be seen as a communist analogue to the capitalist dead mall: a once-vibrant physical community center that has become outmoded with economic decline and the rise of Internet-based communities. Economic reforms in 1990s China led to privately-owned businesses outcompeting state enterprises. Corruption and increased competition caused state-owned manufacturing plants to decline, and their employees were laid off en masse. The resulting economic depression in these areas created urban decay. The northeast, more so than other regions, was both economically and culturally enmeshed with the Communist state.

" Despite the Portuguese language not being widely spoken in Slovenia there is interest towards Portuguese culture, literature and products. The Portuguese language has a remarkable and projection in Slovenia, it is taught at the University of Ljubljana, and numerous works by great Portuguese-speaking writers and poets have been translated into Slovene in recent years. In 2021, two of the main works of exponents of Brazilian and Portuguese literature, Machado de Assis and Eça de Queirós, respectively ""Quincas Borba"" and ""O Crime do Padre Amaro"", were translated into Slovene. Other popular Lusophone authors include Saramago and Pessoa. In 2019 Portugal and Slovenia signed an agreement for enhancing cultural exchanges between the two nations and, since 2022, Slovenia is no longer the only Member State of the European Union without a university degree in Portuguese Language and Culture.As of today, the Portuguese are part of a wider Portuguese-speaking community in Slovenia, comprising around 60 people from PALOP countries (the majority being from Guinea-Bissau), Timor-Leste or Macau and around 350 Brazilians. People from CPLP countries thus number around 500 people, accounting for 0.02% of the population of Slovenia."

" In poem 3.13 Sulpicia calls herself ""Sulpicia daughter of Servius"" (Servi filia Sulpicia), and in poem 3.13 she addresses Messalla (presumably Tibullus's patron Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, consul in 31 BC) as propinque ""relative"". On this basis Haupt (1871) identified Sulpicia as the granddaughter of Cicero's friend, Servius Sulpicius Rufus (consul 51 BC), who died in 43 BC, whose son is said to have married Messalla's sister. If so, Sulpicia would have been Messalla's niece. Some scholars write that she was Servius Sulpicius Rufus's daughter; if so, this would make Messalla her brother-in-law. Cērinthus, from the Greek κήρινθος ""bee bread"", is thought to be a synonym. Because of the similarity of consonants (c, r, n, t), as well as the metrical equivalence of the two names, and the resemblance between Greek κέρας keras ""horn"" and Latin cornu ""horn"", it has been suggested that Cerinthus may be the same as the friend, Cornutus, to whom Tibullus addresses a birthday poem (Tibullus 2.2), as well as a longer poem (2.3). The close verbal echoes between 2.2 and the some of the poems in the Garland (see below) are also suggestive that the works are in some way connected and that Cornutus and Cerinthus are the same person. One suggestion (if the Garland dates from the time of Tibullus) is that the Garland may have been written to celebrate the anniversary of Sulpicia and Cornutus's marriage."	Sulpicia may have been the granddaughter of Cicero's friend, Servius Sulpicius Rufus, who died in 43 BC.
 After teenager Ann Somerton's father Andrew is killed during construction of the new Windsor Line for the London Underground, her mother Lilian receives a substantial amount of compensation. Ann, her mother and her mother's new boyfriend - Neville Chandler, who Ann believes is only interested in getting the large insurance pay-out - are invited to join the Mayor's party on the line's maiden train. Passing through a tunnel, Ann sees a vision of her father as one of a gang of ragged workers and faints. This draws the attention of a journalist from the Daily Globe, who begins to investigate. No-one believes her story, but Ann begins dreaming of her father, begging her to help. She returns to the line alone and has another vision, this time seeing her father being beaten by sinister figures. Desperate to find more, she visits her father's old friend Mr. Carstairs, an expert on the Underground, and learns of the old Prince Albert line in the same place decades before, which was covered up after a tunnel collapsed. Meanwhile, the journalist and his photographer venture into the tunnels, only to vanish. Ann spots a photograph of Victorian industrialist Lord Vicary in a magazine, and recognises him as the ringleader in her visions, and - despite her mother's increasingly histrionic attempts to get her to stop her daughter's obsession - returns to the Windsor Line after speaking to Globe editor Franklin, who instigates a police search of the tunnel. However, while Ann sees the two newsmen now among the workers, the police don't. After a spell committed to Stapleton Clinic, Ann pretends there was nothing behind her visions, and requests a visit to Vicary Hall, now a stately home that allows guided tours. She discovers Vicary conducted secretive botanical experiments and had a dim view of the growing worker's rights movement before disappearing in the Prince Albert Line disaster. Ann is later able to return to the Windsor Line in secret, but is accosted by the demonic Vicary before escaping with the help of an Underground worker. She follows them back to the ruins of the Albert Line. Using his botany research, Vicary and his right-hand thug Brock have prolonged their own lives and kidnapped her father and his workmates as well as others to build them an underground town. Ann is captured too, and finds Vicary is using drugs to keep control. With the aid of Vicary's abused maid Lucy, Ann is able to get to her father. The police meanwhile are drilling in the Underground as they search for Ann, having found a picture taken by the photographer that corroborates her story. Falling masonry kills Vicary as he prepares to attack Ann. The captives are freed, while those exposed to Vicary's drug are found an island where they can live, with the government covering the incident up so they can live in peace. Andrew returns to his family, sending Neville packing, and Ann has her father back.	The story of a young woman's obsession with a Victorian industrialist who kidnapped and killed her father is told through the eyes of a journalist and a photographer.
 The main Swedish consumer cooperative organisation, Kooperativa Förbundet (KF), was founded in 1899, with the organisation being a dominant player in the Swedish market throughout the 20th century. The main brand of KF stores was Konsum, though it was one among many, with many different chains existing within the KF organisation. Ahead of the merger into Coop Norden KF centralised their branding under the Coop name in the early 2000s, with larger Konsum stores becoming Coop Konsum, and various hypermarket brands being centralised as Coop Forum.In 2015 the Coop chain was rebranded as part of a reorganisation within the KF organisation, with stores being branded under the Coop, Stora Coop and the short-lived Lilla Coop names.

" The building of the museum was originally a house established by a merchant named ""Abd al-Jabbar al-Khudairi"" in the late 19th century. It at one point belonged to Halil Kut of the Ottoman Empire. The house became a distinguished heritage building in terms of planning, architectural elements, distinguished woodwork, shanasheel, and the neighborhoods where the house was located. The Ministry of Tourism maintained the house and revived it as a heritage museum for Abd-al Karim Qasim. The museum contains Qasim's personal belongings and rare gifts. After maintenance, the museum was opened on the 9th of February, 2015, and was attended by his family and loved ones, as well as official, academic and cultural figures. The museum was opened to preserve the history of the country so that future generations can be aware of it. It also hinted that a similar museum in Basra dedicated to poet Badr Shakir al-Sayyab could be opened. The museum includes five halls, the first of which included the personal belongings of the leader, and the other was allocated for gifts, weapons, archives, and documents."	A museum dedicated to the Iraqi revolutionary leader Abd-al Karim Qasim has been opened in the city of Basra, in the south of the country.
 Born in 1941 in Thiès, Senegal, Sow studied filmmaking in Paris at the Conservatoire libre du cinéma français (CLCF, fr) and subsequently worked in French and Senegalese television. He directed documentary shorts and three feature films on his own: Guereo, village de Djibril N'Diaye (1970), L'Option / Mon beau pays (1974), and L'Œil (1981). Sow is best known for the historical drama film Camp de Thiaroye about the Thiaroye massacre near Dakar on December 1, 1944, which he cowrote and codirected with Ousmane Sembène. It won the Grand Special Jury Prize at the 45th Venice International Film Festival in 1988. Sow also performed as a movie actor in two feature films, Nuit africaine (1990) by Gérard Guillaume and cowriters Gaston Kaboré and Lapeyssonie, and Guelwaar (1992) by Ousmane Sembène. Sow died from illness in Dakar on December 6, 2009.	Olivier Sow, best known for his role as a film director, has died at the age of 93. He was one of the best-known actors in the French and Senegalese film industry.
" A pre-company is a trading combination from the Republic that traded in Asia between 1594 and 1602, before the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was founded. The pre-companies were financed by wealthy Northern Netherlands merchants and wealthy immigrants from the Southern Netherlands. Because of the cutthroat competition, the companies were forced in 1602 by the government to unite for 21 years in the VOC, which was given exclusive right to trade in Asia.Before the VOC (I+J+K+L) was founded in 1602, 12 different pre-companies existed in the space of 7 years: According to a contemporary, ""people sailed each other's money out of the purse and the shoes off their feet"". A total of fifteen expeditions were sent out between 1594 and 1601 in which 65 ships took part, including four ships of the ""First Dutch Expedition to East Indies"", and excluding the three barre and failed trips through the North Cape."	"The Dutch East India Company (I+J+K+L) has been named as a ""Dutch Pre-Companies"" for the first time."
 Informateur Wim van der Grinten explored the possibility of bringing together PvdA, CDA and D'66 without success. The former KVP state secretary was appointed on the recommendation of Van Agt to 'investigate the possibilities of forming a cabinet in the shortest possible time that can be confident of receiving sufficient support from the parliament'. Van der Grinten tried to force a breakthrough with various compromises, but together with the negotiators he concluded that the 'implementation problem' was unsolvable. Van der Grinten then investigated whether PvdA wanted to work with VVD, but Van Thijn rejected this. The discussions between CDA and VVD subsequently led to an agreement within a week. The conversations between Van Agt and Wiegel started on 14 November. On Wiegel's recommendation, they decided to strive to keep it short and concise. Wiegel's proposal to keep the outside world - including their factions - out was also adopted. Even council advisor Herman Tjeenk Willink and director of the Government Information Service Gijs van der Wiel, who had always been there until then, were sent away. Already in the first conversation they managed to make agreements about the WIR, the VAD, the works councils and the distribution of ministerial posts. Parts of the agreement with PvdA and D'66 were adopted, such as the abortion paragraph. What helped was the good atmosphere between the party leaders, in contrast to the conversations between Van Agt with Van Thijn and Den Uyl. The draft agreement was sent to the factions on 22 November. The VVD quickly agreed, but under pressure from ARP members such as Aantjes and Scholten, dozens of amendments were submitted. Wiegel responded with understanding and an amended agreement was reached on 26 November. The VVD faction unanimously agreed to the result on 28 November. An extensive consultation took place at the CDA, which continued until the early morning. The majority voted in favor, but six faction members — Aantjes, Hans de Boer, Beumer, Van Houwelingen, Scholten (all from ARP) and Dijkman (KVP) — voted against. They indicated that they tolerated the cabinet and were known as the CDA loyalists. During a faction meeting on 5 December Willem de Kwaadsteniet also joined this group. Because of this tolerating support, there was some commotion, because Van der Grinten's assignment was to create a parliamentary majority cabinet. PvdA objected to this, but this had no effect. On 2 December the parties reached an agreement in principle on the distribution of ministerial posts. Van Agt was the intended prime minister, after Jelle Zijlstra, Pierre Lardinois, Jan van den Brink and Roelof Nelissen had resigned.

 The principle of the ethological halter seems to have been discovered by American Horse Whisperer Tom Dorrance. The American veterinarian Robert M. Miller believes that its use in the USA stems from the bosal hackamore of the Vaqueros, which has been adopted by almost all practitioners of natural horsemanship in the form of a rope halter with knots. According to Cynthia McFarland, American cowboys were the first to discover and make a rope halter. The use of this equipment spread from the United States to France in the early 2000s, as well as to Germany, accompanying the development of ethological equitation. French rider Michel Robert is a pioneer in the world of show jumping. Equestrian equipment manufacturers have adapted to demand. Many now offer this type of halter for sale, with a wide choice of models, colors and materials, and knots that can be placed in different ways. In the United States, the marketing of an ethological halter supposed to make horses softer, under the name of be-nice, has sparked debate.

 For a number of years there had been a disagreement in Scottish athletics over whether professional cycle racing events should be allowed at amateur athletics meetings. There were strong views both in favour and against the position, and arriving at a deadlock in their negotiations several western district clubs in favour of allowing professional cycle events, led by Clydesdale Harriers, seceded from the SAAA and formed the Scottish Amateur Athletics Union (SAAU). The consequence of this was that there were two national championships in both 1895 and 1896 held under the auspices of the two separate bodies. In both years the two championships were held on the same day, with the SAAA adhering to their policy of alternating between an Eastern and a Western venue, while the SAAU held their championship at Hampden Park, Glasgow on both occasions. == References ==	There is disclosed a new process for the running of professional cycle racing events in amateur athletics.
 During the late 19th century, the growth of Oberschöneweide and Niederschöneweide was closely linked to the rapid expansion of Berlin's large-scale industry. The presence of railways and waterways provided favorable conditions for the establishment of industrial settlements. At the same time, however, constructing paths and roads and connecting them to the Chausseenetz of the district of Teltow became necessary. To create the first permanent link between the two banks of the Spree River, a chain ferry was established in 1885, and funded by the district. The ferry connection operated until 1891 when it was replaced by a wooden bridge in 1890/1891. This bridge also accommodated the tracks of the Oberschöneweide industrial railroad (Bullenbahn), which connected seventeen newly established factories in Oberschöneweide to the Berlin-Görlitz railroad line. The 121-meter-long bridge over the Spree was a wooden truss structure with nine openings, with three in the middle serving as ship passages. In addition to this bridge, other Spree crossings were built around the same time, such as the Kaisersteg (1898, pedestrian bridge) and the Treskowbrücke (1904), which together helped to relieve traffic in Schöneweide. However, the wooden bridge quickly deteriorated and, after only ten years, a new fixed crossing was urgently needed. The district administration opted for a steel bridge constructed of three arches of unequal length, which also had to accommodate the tracks of the industrial railroad leading to the Oberschöneweide factories. The new construction led to re-routing streetcar lines operated by the Berlin Ostbahnhof exclusively over the neighboring Treskow Bridge. The bridge plans were developed by Berlin civil engineer Karl Bernhard, who was also responsible for the superstructure. Preparatory work began in 1905, and the entire construction costs were covered by the municipality. Before the new Stubenrauch Bridge was built, there was only the Kaisersteg for pedestrians to cross the Spree and the later Treskow Bridge for vehicles, but the latter was a rather dilapidated wooden structure at the time. When the new bridge was inaugurated, it was named Stubenrauchbrücke in honor of the former Teltow district administrator, Ernst von Stubenrauch.	The Stubenrauch Bridge is the first permanent link between the two banks of the Spree River in Berlin . It was built to relieve traffic between Oberschöneweide and Niederschöneide .

 In 1541, 1542 or 1543 (sources differ) Portugal established contact with Japan. Japan was then involved in a long civil-war but since Ming China had officially cut relations with Japan meant that Portuguese merchants could serve as an profitable commercial intermediary between the two nations. In 1550, the Portuguese Crown created an official trade route linking Goa, capital of its holdings in Asia, and Japan, and every year one or a number of large tradeships would sail to Japan and back, commanded by a captain-major. The Portuguese found enthusiastic commercial and diplomatical partners among Japanese lords and some, like Ōtomo Sōrin and Ōmura Sumitada converted to Christianity. Instability in Japan, or other reasons, meant that the Portuguese would occasionally be drawn into internal Japanese conflicts.	The Portuguese had been trading with Japan since the time of the Ming dynasty, but the relationship between the two nations was not as close as it is now.
" News of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces. The threat of mutiny was rife. Admiral Reinhard Scheer and Ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the ""valour"" of the German Navy. In northern Germany, the German Revolution of 1918–1919 began at the end of October 1918. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost, initiating the uprising. The sailors' revolt, which then ensued in the naval ports of Wilhelmshaven and Kiel, spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918, shortly thereafter to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and to German surrender."

" The game consists of four quadrants: four players choose their own squares; begins with the 4th square diagonally serving to the 2nd square; the 2nd then returns the ball with one hit to any square to start the rally. When the ball lands in a player’s square they are eliminated, and the player in the 4th square always scores a point but only if the player in the 4th square is not eliminated (otherwise, no points are received by any); the remaining three players all rotate clockwise, and the eliminated player keeps their points but goes back to the 1st square OR is replaced by a new player in the 1st square. The game is played to 11 points (win by 2). A player is eliminated when: the ball lands on the ground inside their own square; player returns the ball out of bounds; failing to hit the ball into another square; double hitting the ball; hitting the ball incorrectly; or hitting the ball out of turn. The ball is considered in play when the ball lands on the outside boundary. Players are not allowed to catch, hold, or carry the ball at any point during play.

" Ichikawa Ennosuke IV was born on 26 November 1975, in Tokyo, Japan, into a family with deep connections to the kabuki tradition. He is the son of Ichikawa Danshirō IV, a kabuki actor known for his aragoto style of performances. Ennosuke made his first stage appearance as the child emperor Antoku in the kabuki production Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura at the age of 5. Three years later in 1983, he took the stage name Ichikawa Kamejirō II (二代目 市川 亀治郎, Nidaime Ichikawa Kamejirō). He became known for his tachiyaku and onnagata roles over the course of his career, in addition to his repertoire of dances. Ennosuke made his television debut in 2007 in the taiga drama Fūrin Kazan as Takeda Shingen, from there he began being cast in major supporting roles in high-profile dramas such as Ryōmaden (2010), Naoki Hanzawa (2020), and The 13 Lords of the Shogun (2022). He has also made several film appearances. In 2012, his uncle Kinoshi Masahiko, stage name Ichikawa Ennosuke III, retired from kabuki and passed his appellation to Takahiko, heretofore known as Kamejirō II. From this point on, Takahiko would become known as Ichikawa Ennosuke IV, the fourth in his family to carry the name. Ennosuke IV has carried on his predecessor's mission in revitalizing the art of kabuki to attract contemporary audiences with what's called ""Super Kabuki"" productions, playing a central role in a kabuki reimagining of the manga One Piece (Super Kabuki II: One Piece) that achieved major commercial success."

" Sharma's first ascent of Es Pontàs featured prominantly in the award-winning 2007 climbing film, King Lines, which became an iconic film in rock climbing. Images of Sharma soloing on the dramatic and overhanging arch above deep blue sea, adorned the covers of most climbing magazines, showcasing DWS to the global climbing community. In 2016, Rock & Ice said: ""The silhouette of Sharma on the underside of the Es Pontàs arch is an indelible image for climbers of the mid-2000s"". In a 2016 interview with Climbing, when DWS pioneer Miquel Riera was asked about the most impressive DWS ascent, he replied: ""Have you seen Chris Sharma on Es Pontàs? That should answer your question"". Sharma said of his ascent: ""... definitely a pivotal experience in my life that set me on an entirely new path in my life and in the world"". He also said: ""... deep water soloing embodies for me the perfect form of climbing. Take Es Pontàs for instance, it’s a route I put up in Mallorca. It's 5.15, but I can solo it. For me, that's as good as it gets"". Climbing considered his ascent of Es Pontàs as being another example of Sharma's talent for ""... the genius to see the potential, coupled with the commitment to spend months and years of his life proving it"". Climbing also noted that the ascent, and increased profile Sharma brought to DWS, as being another example of his influence on the development of the sport of modern rock climbing, saying: ""Sharma shaped modern rock climbing.

" Early Abiy Ahmed tenure was characterized by major reforms in human rights, including releasing several political prisoners that were detained by EPRDF regime. After the Tigrayan rebels captured Amhara Region, Abiy declared state of emergency on 2 November 2021, encouraging mass arrests individuals ""suspected of collaborating with terrorist groups"" without warrant. The US government, various human rights groups and mainstream media accused the declaration of ethnic profiling against Tigrayans. Secret vigilantes operated in Addis Ababa and submitted individuals to the government supposed supporting the TPLF and OLA rebels. Tigrayan civilians were mostly detained in Western Tigray Zone. The detentions continued after the state of emergency in the capital Addis Ababa, targeting towards to some UN staffs members who were taken from their homes. According to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, 16 staff members of Ethiopian citizen detained while six others were freed. On 20 May 2022, Brigadier General Tefera Mamo, who led the Amharan army against Tigrayan force during the Tigray War, was arrested after a comment criticizing Abiy and his affiliation in Amhara region of being ""motivated by money"". Also, by 23 May 2022, the number of arrest has been inclined; 4,500 journalists and activists were arrested in what is called ""law enforcement operations"" by the government. While Abiy state the mass arrest is justified because of stability and security reasons, critics accused the government of utterly human rights violation, including extrajudicial killings. On 5 January 2023, the Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO) experts Daniel Tesfaye, Bezuayehu Wondimu, Bereket Daniel and Nahom Husen went to a village called Alem Bank in west Addis Ababa to investigate people whose houses are demolished by the Addis Ababa municipal government.

 The cave is located in the Thal-Kittelsthal karst complex, a former Zechstein reef. This region was in a threshold position at the beginning of the Zechstein period; Thuringia was covered by the Zechstein Sea, which had only a shallow water depth in this threshold region. In these shallow water areas, favored by the climatic conditions, many calcareous coral reef found a habitat. These reef-builders died off under increasingly inhospitable living conditions and were gradually covered by sediments of the higher Zechstein. The Thuringian Forest was uplifted by Saxonian fracture block tectonics; to a lesser extent this also affected areas of the foreland such as the Kittelsthal region, parts of which were later eroded again. This provided favorable conditions for karstification. Water sank over fissures and ponors in the reef complex and the dripstone caves began to form. In larger cavities, the dissolution of the limestone by carbonic acid formed stalactites, stalagmites and stalagnates of various sizes and shapes. In the cave there are also sporadic eccentrics, sideways or upward curved outgrowths of a few centimeters in length, independent of gravity.

 Both the Flyers and Islanders, two expansion teams established in 1967 and 1972, respectively, saw success and winning early into their franchises histories, something unusual among most expansion franchises in NHL history. By the time the two teams met for their first playoff matchup in the 1975 semifinals, the Flyers had just won the Stanley Cup in the previous season, in just their seventh season of existence. The Islanders were making their first playoff appearance in just their third season of existence. The Islanders had advanced to the semifinals after becoming the second team in NHL history to come back from a 3–0 series deficit, as they defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins in seven games. In the series, the Flyers, the first seed, jumped to a 3–0 series lead over the Islanders. However, the Islanders responded by winning the next three games to force a game seven, but unlike their quarterfinal matchup, they were unable to complete the comeback, as the Flyers prevailed in game seven, 4–1. The Flyers advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals and defeated the Buffalo Sabres to win their second straight Stanley Cup.

 Entering service on 22 April 1985 on the Bluemull Sound service, taking over from the original MV Geira, which was then sold out of the fleet. She operated alone on the Gutcher, Yell - Belmont, Unst - Oddsta, Fetlar service until 1988 when she was joined by MV Fylga. Once the two new Yell ferries were introduced in 2004, MV Bigga replaced Fylga on the service. This is the same year that the Fetlar terminal changed from Oddsta to Hamars Ness. Due to a vessel change, on 3 October 2005, Fivla was relegated to the fleet relief vessel, which she still operates as today. Each month she covers a different ro-ro ferry in the fleet so that they can go for their annual refit. She also covers any breakdowns that occur across the fleet. The only rest the ferry gets is when she goes for her own annual refit, normally on the Malakoff slip in Lerwick. On 28 April 2010, while carrying out refit cover in Yell Sound, she was trapped underneath the linkspan in Toft. This was due to four preventer chains on the linkspan snapping simultaneously from the low spring tides and the lower freeboard of the relief vessel. Due to this, during the following days (29 April and 4 May 2010), she operated a special service between Vidlin and Ulsta, Yell. == References ==	This is a series of articles relating to the operation and maintenance of a fleet of vessels.
 After the period of Arab rule in Armenia and the South Caucasus, a new period of cultural flourishing began, and active church building was accompanied by new sculptural compositions and solutions. The “first signs” were khachkars (crossstones), which partially continued the tradition of four-sided stelae, forming an original compositional and iconographic system. The period of great and small kingdoms in Armenia, the 9th-11th centuries, was characterized by the formation of several large cultural centers and artistic styles: in Shirak (Shirakavan, Argina, Kars, Ani), Tayk (Ishkhan, Banak, Chordvan, Khakhu), Vaspurakan (Aghtamar), Syunik (Tatev, Bgheno-Noravank). In 915-921 by the order of Gagik Artsruni, the Armenian king of Vaspurakan, one of the unique Armenian monuments, the Church of the Holy Cross on the Aghtamar island was built. The peculiarity of the building was the modest size of the church, the facades of which the architect Manuel managed to decorate with an unprecedented number of sculptures and extensive scenes. The animal types in reliefs are also unprecedented, including fabulous ones. Alternating each other uninterrupted rows of scenes and images of the Aghtamar church seem to be the visual embodiments of the Holy Bible. The monumental images of King Gagik and the deified ancestors of the Artsruni family also found their place in this “Heavenly World”. The 9th-11th centuries Armenian sculpture is rich in images of patrons. On the tympanum of the main entrance of the church of Yerznka (near Ani) (895) were depicted two princes on horseback before the Virgin and Child and accompanied by angels (destroid). In the second half of the 10th century, the high relief figures of the crowned princes Gurgen and Smbat Bagratuni were depicted on the eastern facades of the main churches of Sanahin and Haghpat monasteries (St. Amenaprkich church 966, St. Nshan church 976). And the representatives of the younger branch of Bagratuni (in Tayk), Bagrat and David, were solemnly depicted in Oshkvank (963-973). The compositions of Aghtamar and Oshkvank had direct iconographic correlation to Byzantine imperial images (the mosaic of Constantine and Justinian, St. Sophia, end of the 10th century). And the almost round sculpture of Smbat Bagratuni in Haghpat got its further development in the two-meter statue of King Gagik of Ani, which once decorated the façade of the church of St. Grigor- Gagkashen (1001-1020, architect Trdat). A group of frontal sculptural faces are pre-their unique decorations. That composition consisted of blind arcades extending along the facades of the church and a sculptured “belt” of the Heavenly Garden inhabited by birds, animals, and sometimes with human figures.	The Church of the Holy Cross in the Aghtamar island of Armenia has been built for the first time in hundreds of years.
 The Pan-ArcticVision is quite unique in the way that it is one of few attempts to not just the euro-arctic region, the Barents region, the Nordics, the American arctic or the international inuit community, but to in fact include the whole circumpolar North.

" After the release of X&Y (2005), Coldplay decided to build their own recording studio. Chris Martin commented their former workplace ""felt a little dirty"" and the band ""weren't really speaking to each other. We all had our corner office in a big tower block, but there was no vibe"". Furthermore, they bought an old bakery in 2006 to help them refocus and established it as their headquarters. The building is intercalated between ""an estate agent and tiny restaurant"". Will Champion described it as a ""giant version"" of Jonny Buckland's room in Camden Road, from when the group studied at University College London.

Images of Sharma soloing on the dramatic and overhanging arch above deep blue sea, adorned the covers of most climbing magazines, showcasing DWS to the global climbing community. In 2016, Rock & Ice said: ""The silhouette of Sharma on the underside of the Es Pontàs arch is an indelible image for climbers of the mid-2000s"". In a 2016 interview with Climbing, when DWS pioneer Miquel Riera was asked about the most impressive DWS ascent, he replied: ""Have you seen Chris Sharma on Es Pontàs? That should answer your question"". Sharma said of his ascent: ""... definitely a pivotal experience in my life that set me on an entirely new path in my life and in the world"". He also said: ""... deep water soloing embodies for me the perfect form of climbing. Take Es Pontàs for instance, it’s a route I put up in Mallorca. It's 5.15, but I can solo it. For me, that's as good as it gets"". Climbing considered his ascent of Es Pontàs as being another example of Sharma's talent for ""... the genius to see the potential, coupled with the commitment to spend months and years of his life proving it"". Climbing also noted that the ascent, and increased profile Sharma brought to DWS, as being another example of his influence on the development of the sport of modern rock climbing, saying: ""Sharma shaped modern rock climbing.

" Clarke Garrison was portrayed from 1987 to 1992 and from 1996 to 2009 by Daniel McVicar. McVicar describes Clarke as ""the classic heel with a heart, a cad with a conscience"". He is a former fashion designer for the now-defunct Spectra Fashions. Originally a student at Otis Parsons Institute the eternally ambitious character has always wrestled with the balance between ambition and questions of the heart. He has two sons, C.J. (Mick Cain) from his marriage to Sally Spectra (played by Darlene Conley), and Mark (Michael Dietz) from his affair with Margo Lynley (Lauren Koslow). He was also once married to Kristen Forrester (then played by Teri Ann Linn). Their relationship began when Kristen's mother, Stephanie (Susan Flannery), hired Clarke to seduce Kristen, fearing that her daughter was frigid. Clarke began to have feelings for Kristen and they married, before splitting later. Clarke left town in September 1992, returning four years later to see his son, C.J. (then played by Kyle Sabihy). C.J. wanted nothing to do with his father, angry at Clarke for walking out on him and Sally. This changed when Clarke rescued him from kidnappers. Clarke and Sally remained close friends; she affectionately called him ""Bucky"". He also shared a bond with Sally's former receptionist, Darla (Schae Harrison), who Sally thought of as a daughter. After a disastrous flirtation with Morgan DeWitt (Sarah Buxton), which almost ended with Clarke being killed by her pet python, ""Patsy"", Clarke began to woo a recently returned Kristen (now Tracy Melchior). His attempts at seducing his ex-wife were unsuccessful, as Kristen moved on with Tony Dominguez (Paulo Benedeti). Clarke's most notable lapse in judgement was in early 2005, when he reluctantly helped a vengeful Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz) trap Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss) and his stepdaughter Bridget Forrester (Ashley Jones) down a mineshaft in the hope that they would give into their ""feelings"" for one another, destroying Ridge's marriage to Bridget's mother, Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang). Amber received the ammunition she needed, and she and Clarke escaped prosecution due to Sally's pleas for Stephanie not to press charges. It seems, however, that the Forresters have forgiven Clarke for this crime, as he is often present at their family gatherings. Until recently Clarke worked at Forrester Creations, as the new head designer, after being hired by the new owners at that time, Nick (Jack Wagner) and Jackie Marone (Lesley-Anne Down). He was demoted to designer after Brooke returned to Forrester Creations and was made head designer. After Eric Forrester (John McCook) bought back Forrester Creations, he was under no obligation to honor Clarke's contract and Clarke was released from the company. Not too long after Jackie Marone and Dominick Marone sold Forrester Creations back to the Forresters, Clarke found himself once again back at Spectra Fashions. Because the new owners of Spectra Fashions had gone bankrupt, the company was reverted to Sally Spectra. As she no longer wanted to run the business, Sally Spectra asked Clarke and their son C.J. to sell the business for her. Knowing Jackie and her son would be interested, Clarke made his way to their home. One thing led to the next and Nick purchased the company making Clarke their head designer. The company was later renamed ""M Fashions"". Clarke worked at Jackie M Designs, the company formerly known as Spectra Fashions."

Vijayalaya Chola's predecessor is Srikantha Choladhiraja according to Anbil plates of Parantaka Chola II.

 On January 13, 1765, Van Eck, accompanied by Koopman and other officers, embarked on a journey from Colombo to rendezvous with an army stationed at Gonavila. Their route took them through Negombo and Tambaravila. Subsequent intelligence revealed that the Kandyans were bolstering their forces and fortifications, actively preparing for a potential invasion. Despite numerous challenges including widespread illnesses and frequent skirmishes, the Dutch army managed to persevere and eventually reached Kandy. Their journey led them through various locations, including Katugampola, Etambole, Visnave, Pidaravala, Kurunegala, Teliangona, and Vauda. Their final destination was the heavily fortified Galagedra fortress, which posed significant challenges to overcome. Nevertheless, after a day of concerted efforts, the fortress was successfully captured. The main army successfully crossed the Hoenay Oya on the morning of February 16. Upon reaching Katugastota along the banks of the Mahaweli River, they encountered another colonel who had already established a camp in the vicinity. Occupying the king's pleasure residence, they proceeded to plunder it. Subsequently, on February 19, they crossed the river. Arriving at the king's palace, they observed the king's absence. This led them to remain there for three days, during which they engaged in looting and plundering. Notably, substantial Kandyan forces emerged, bearing white flags as a sign of submission to the company. This event unfolded on February 22, and Van Eck, in response, conducted promotions for army officers and generals. The invasion proceeded with notable success, characterized by a lack of setbacks. Swiftly advancing and overcoming every Kandyan army they encountered, they demonstrated remarkable progress. In a parallel effort, another contingent led by Colonel Wesel, numbering 700 men, set out to dismantle the king's alternate palace. Upon receiving information that the king was residing there. Upon reaching the palace, it became evident that the king had fled again, the soldiers plundered and looted it again. As this group returned, they fell victim to an ambush, resulting in the unfortunate death of 48 soldiers on March 4. On the same day, Van Eck, along with fellow officers, journeyed back to Colombo. During their absence, Colonel Feber assumed responsibility for overseeing the occupation. Van Eck's return was met with a warm welcome and congratulations for the successful campaign. However, news soon arrived that the Kandyans had adopted guerrilla warfare tactics, launching an attack on a transport and a farm. Colonel Feber, who was in charge of the occupation, sought additional reinforcements in response to sporadic guerrilla warfare activities. Subsequently, following a significant engagement between Dutch forces and Kandyan insurgents on March 24th, reinforcements successfully entered occupied Kandy. During a battle while marching to Feber, Major Franken's troops emerged victorious against the Kandyan forces, compelling them to retreat to higher terrain. After a period of illness within the Dutch ranks and subsequent skirmishes with the Kandyan adversaries, diplomatic negotiations eventually led to the establishment of a peace agreement.

 The period before menstruation, known as the premenstrual phase, is often linked to emotional distress. Conditions related to the menstrual cycle encompass premenstrual tension syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and the exacerbation of another medical condition during the premenstrual phase. Menstruation is linked to a range of psychopathological symptoms, such as lower self-esteem, increased anxiety, dysphoria, and feelings of being persecuted. Changes in behavior, like decreased social interaction during menstruation, can lead to feelings of loneliness and potentially contribute to the development of depression. Several reviews have reported that psychopathological symptoms and mental disorders, such as psychoses, suicidal tendencies, post-traumatic stress disorder, and addictive behaviors, tend to worsen during menstruation. Variations in ovarian hormone levels are also linked to the presence of symptoms related to eating disorders. Some comprehensive studies have indicated that women might be at a higher risk of suicide during menstruation. The symptoms occurring during menstruation can have a significant impact on mental health and lead to severe consequences.	Menstruation is one of the most common medical conditions associated with the menstrual cycle, according to the British Medical Association.
 “My works always seem to present a magical, dreamy, and even surreal style and it is because what I want to create is not just a beautiful space, but a spatial experience for visitors.” “Design creates value.” Li Xiang’s work involves the exploration of artistic expression, practicality, and creating new paradigms for futuristic design. The inspiration for her work is derived from her ambition to make the world a better place by making space both a beautiful and spatial experience based on the image of a world she would like to see. It is noted that Li Xiang’s workflow approach is considered unconventional when compared to other architectural practices, where the initial design phase involves mainly working digitally to allow for flexibility and rarely ever on paper.	Award-winning Chinese architect Li Xiang has been honoured with a gold medal from the Chinese Academy of Architecture for her work in the field of interior design.
 In 1878, the Oviedo City Council received an application for permission to build the mining railway on Monte Naranco, which raised concerns as it was feared that the construction of the railway would affect the water supply of Fitoria, as it ran parallel to that of the future railway line. On 1 February 1880, the original 7,101-metre (7,766 yd) long mining railway between the Villapérez area and the northern station of Oviedo operated by the Compañía de los Ferrocarriles de Asturias, Galicia y León was inaugurated with an original length of 7.1 km (4.4 mi). The total cost of building the railway was 129,906 pesetas, including 19,798 pesetas for expropriations.	A new railway line has been officially opened in Oviedo, Spain, following the discovery of a controversial site.

" People have willingly arranged to be buried alive, reportedly demonstrating their disputed ability to survive such an event for many centuries. The fear of being buried alive peaked during the cholera epidemics of the 19th century, but accounts of unintentional live burial have been recorded even earlier. Reports of doctors and accounts in literature heightened these fears. The subject is detailed in ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" and ""The Cask of Amontillado"", Edgar Allan Poe wrote ""The Premature Burial"", which was published in 1844. It contained accounts of supposedly genuine cases of premature burial and detailing the narrator's (perceived) interment while still alive. In 1822, German Dr. Adolf Gutsmuth was buried alive several times to demonstrate a safety coffin of his design, staying underground for several hours and eating a meal of soup, bratwurst, marzipan, sauerkraut, spätzle, beer, and for dessert, prinzregententorte, delivered to him through the coffin's feeding tube. In 1840, Sadhu Haridas, an Indian yogi, is said to have been buried for ten months. The yogi said that his only fear during his ""wonderful sleep"" was being eaten by underground worms. However, according to current medical science, a human can't survive for ten months without food, water, and air. According to other sources the entire burial was 40 days long. The Indian government has since made voluntary premature burial illegal because of the unintended deaths of individuals attempting to recreate this feat. In 1898, Russian Count Michel de Karnice-Karnicki invented a safety coffin called ""Le Karnice"". A long tube measuring 8.89 cm (3.5 in) in diameter was connected with an aperture in the coffin, with the other end emerging above ground (rather like the periscope of a submarine). Italian Faroppo Lorenzo consented to be buried in ""Le Karnice"". On 17 December 1898, he was buried and emerged on the 26th of December. Signor Lorenzo’s only comment, when dug up after this dismal underground Christmas vacation, was that it had been ""damned smelly down there""."	Premature burial has been a controversial topic in the United States for many years, with many people believing they could not survive such an event if they were buried alive.

" The renovations made by Robertson Ward from 1934 to 1935 converted both structures from an Italianate design to the Regency Revival style and also architecturally harmonized the two buildings. Ward added a loggia with columns and wall details including blind arches and paired pilasters supporting a frieze, cornice and pediment to the forecourt, which was separated from the street by a unique iron fence decorated with anchors and drafting tools that extended in front of No. 150. Lanterns on the sides of the front gate to the forecourt depict ""150"" and ""152"" to represent the house numbers of the complex. The front doorway to No. 152 is raised four steps from the ground and has glass side lights with delicate pilasters supporting a molded entablature and a transom; iron trellises were used in lieu of columns to support a scalloped bronze canopy covering the stoop. The front façade of the house has double-hung sash windows with black shutters and includes a frieze and a cornice crowned by a brick parapet. A formal garden was located behind No. 150, which contained a patch of grass edged with boxwood and was surrounded by pathways, shrubs and trees."	No. 152 is a two-storey Victorian house that was built in the early 19th Century and later converted into a three-bedroom bungalow.
 In 1980, a foreign activist cut nets to release 250 to 300 dolphins caught in fishing on Iki Island. : 80–81 Peter Singer, a researcher in ethical philosophy, came to Japan from Australia to defend. A Japanese district court sentenced the activist to six months in prison, suspended for three years. In December 1980, a joint operation between Futo and Kawana was being conducted in Futo, when a small whale escaped by foreign activists. 。 Demand for dolphins increased as a substitute for whales around the time of the commercial whaling moratorium. The number of porpoises captured increased from 16,515 in 1986 to 40,367 in 1988. As a result, catch limits were established for each fishing method and for each dolphin species, beginning with the 1991 porpoises.	The number of dolphins caught in fishing was increased as a substitute for whales around the time of the commercial moratorium and as a substitute for dolphins caught in fishing on Iki.
 The main Swedish consumer cooperative organisation, Kooperativa Förbundet (KF), was founded in 1899, with the organisation being a dominant player in the Swedish market throughout the 20th century. The main brand of KF stores was Konsum, though it was one among many, with many different chains existing within the KF organisation. Ahead of the merger into Coop Norden KF centralised their branding under the Coop name in the early 2000s, with larger Konsum stores becoming Coop Konsum, and various hypermarket brands being centralised as Coop Forum.In 2015 the Coop chain was rebranded as part of a reorganisation within the KF organisation, with stores being branded under the Coop, Stora Coop and the short-lived Lilla Coop names.	The Swedish chain of supermarket chains, Kooperative, has gone into administration after a merger with the chain's name.

 Shortly after its establishment, the bubble economy collapsed, and it was affected by the Heisei recession and the lost decade that came after. After that, in addition to the recession, there were circumstances unique to the industry, such as construction work to support digital terrestrial broadcasting and a shift away from television. Many stations are small. Also, in the analog era, there were few relay stations Many broadcasting stations do not include all households in broadcast area. For this reason, in areas where direct reception is impossible, install a high-gain antenna in a higher position, rebroadcast cable TV, or even receive it at existing stations in surrounding prefectures. Even in the new Heisei station, there are special circumstances due to geographical relationships. Furthermore, for the above reasons, the scale of the company itself is small, and it tends to have weaker program production and sales capabilities than the TV and radio stations that have opened earlier. In addition, the stations that opened in the latter half of the 1990s were affected by the Heisei recession and were established in a smaller and more compact manner. Low number of employees Headquarters building is small or simple There are few branch offices and branch office networksand other features. As for ITV, for a while the master was placed at an affiliated station outside the prefecture. In contrast to the Nippon TV series (NNN/NNS) and TBS series (JNN), which have many starting stations, and the Fuji TV series (FNN/FNS), which expanded its network with the issuance of a large number of UHF station licenses, the TV Asahi series (ANN) network Expansion was delayed. For this reason, Heisei new stations have the most ANN member stations (out of 24 stations, 11 stations are ANN member stations). Of the 24 Fullnet stations, half joined the Heisei period. In addition, in contrast to the long-established stations led by local newspaper companies, most of the Heisei new stations' major shareholders have key stations and major affiliated stations in the top three. In addition, there are few other affiliated programs on the net, and the proportion of in-house produced programs is also small. Although the number is small, there are newspaper companies that are closely related to the Heisei Shinkyoku (Hokkoku Shimbun, Nagasaki Shimbun, Okinawa Times, etc.). Most of the Heisei new stations have not listed.	Japan's new broadcasting station, ITV, has opened in Japan in the early 1990s. It is a huge expansion of the network.
" The Marble Palace is open to the public and tourists two days a year: January 16 and January 17.

 Chandramukhi was one of the esteemed courtesans of the kingdom of Vijayanagaram. Famous for her beauty as well as her singing and dancing skills, she becomes a royal court dancer. She was in love with Gunasekaran, a fellow court dancer who loved her equally and the pair performed together in court at times. Chandramukhi leads a normal life before Vettaiyan kills her and Gunasekaran. In her spirit form she becomes a force of blind rage and grief with hostile intentions. However she appears to be patient in her goal and possesses Ganga like a parasite, slowly transferring her personality into the host. Throughout it, her host will merge behaviors with her and replicate how the spirit acted in her lifetime, for example, a trait of Chandramukhi was excessive vanity and obsession with how beautiful she looked. In her fully possessed form, Chandramukhi is a compulsive dancer who enjoys listening to the sound of her voice. She also has a demonic and murderous personality when confronted with whom she believes to be Vettaiyan.	Chandramukhi is a court dancer from the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu who is possessed by a demon called Vettaiyan.
" The mining companies that were involved, and most prominent in the Vancouver Islands at the time, were: The Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Limited, the Western Fuel of San Francisco, the Pacific Coast Collieries, and the Nanaimo Coal Company. The Canadian Collieries were based in Cumberland and Extension. Owned by the Dunsmuir family, the company played a significant role in the strike by firing a union leader with the last name ""Mottishaw"". This was one of the strike's leading causes. The Western Fuel of San Francisco was based in Nanaimo and owned many of the mines there. The Pacific Coast Collieries only had minor involvement, and were located in South Wellington. The Nanaimo Coal Company stands apart from the other three, as it was the sole company to ""sign an agreement with the union. ""These mining companies (excluding the Nanaimo Coal Company) were opposed to the unions, because they were a threat to the coal companies' power and authority. They coal companies were also dealing with the competition of fuel oil. Because of the potential replacement of coal as fuel with oil as fuel, they worked the miners extra hard and with less pay. This was in an effort to keep up with fuel oil and to stay in business. They needed to pay workers less in order to make a profit. However, unions demanded more pay, causing an issue for the coal companies. They did not want to increase the miners' pay, at the risk of losing their business, and of the entire coal mining industry being replaced by an alternate fuel source. They also had the support of the government, because the economy was so dependent upon the coal industry."	The Canadian Collieries strike, which took place in the 1960s, was a dispute between unions and the coal companies that owned the mines.
 In total, 191 civilians were killed by the clashes and massacres by the two gangs, although the real total is unknown, due to many bodies having not been found. Ten members of Chen Mechan were killed, including the seven by Celestin. Haitian authorities arrested three people, including the leader of the 400 Mawozo-affiliated Baz 222 gang. The police also installed new checkpoints in Plaine du Cul-de-Sac following the clashes. Several weapons were seized as well. In Butte Boyer, every house was searched and then destroyed by Chen Mechan. In other neighborhoods, eighty-one houses in total were destroyed in the fighting. By June 27, 2022, there had been no trials of the three gang members arrested. The Haitian government had also not released a statement by that time. Chen Mechan members were still conducting raids in Plaine du Cul-de-Sac in late June, looking for 400 Mawozo informants. Many of the displaced fled to the Clericine public square, a majority of whom do not want to return.	The Haitian government has released a statement on the deaths of more than 200 people in fighting between Celestin and Chen Mechan.
 For more than half a century, Zhang made her home in Xi’an, Shaan’xi Province. Her works focus on the unity and harmonious relationship between science and aesthetics, as well as between vernacular and modern. In the 1970s, she undertook the restoration of building structures and gardens of the Tang dynasty. Her ideas on utilising technological and scientific advancements were realised in her conservation and heritage projects, most notably the Shaanxi History Museum. The project is described as a modern architectural project by which traditional architectural elements are used as ingredients of innovation. Beyond revitalising the ancient city and its history, Zhang’s designs present architecture features of the past in the modern context. This approach, often referred as the “Neo-Tang Style”, gained popularity through her works.	Zhang made her home in Xi’an, Shaan’xi Province.

 For a number of years there had been a disagreement in Scottish athletics over whether professional cycle racing events should be allowed at amateur athletics meetings. There were strong views both in favour and against the position, and arriving at a deadlock in their negotiations several western district clubs in favour of allowing professional cycle events, led by Clydesdale Harriers, seceded from the SAAA and formed the Scottish Amateur Athletics Union (SAAU). The consequence of this was that there were two national championships in both 1895 and 1896 held under the auspices of the two separate bodies. In both years the two championships were held on the same day, with the SAAA adhering to their policy of alternating between an Eastern and a Western venue, while the SAAU held their championship at Hampden Park, Glasgow on both occasions. == References ==	There were two national championships in both 1895 and 1896 held under the auspices of the two separate bodies.

" Angela of Metal.de compared 10 Year Anniversary: Live in Reykjavík to Skáldöld's previous live album, Skálmöld & Sinfóníuhljómsveit Íslands (2013), which was recorded with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra, and said the new album displays the band ""at its purest"". She said it reflects the experience of Skálmöld's regular concerts, with the audience singing along in Icelandic throughout the songs, a unique feature of shows in the band's home country. She said the setlist is a good selection from the band's five studio albums and should satisfy both old and new listeners, only missing the track ""Loki"" which otherwise often is part of the live sets. Carl Fisher of Games, Brrraaains & A Head-Banging Life wrote that the quality of the audio production sometimes makes it sound like a studio album, while at the same time, the audience can be heard clearly. Folk-metal.nl highlighted the audio production, and wrote that although the ""cold brooding air"" from the studio album Sorgir (2018) is not reproduced live, that is weighed up by the participation from the audience, which almost functions as a choir."	Icelandic rock band Skáldöld have released a new live album, which appears to be recorded in the country's Symphony Orchestra.
" On April 8, the Ottoman army passed Ochkhamuri, but did not go through the valley and took refuge in the forest between Ochkhamuri and Cholok. Mazniashvili ordered the armored train to retreat. The armored personnel carrier was supposed to be in the rearguard, but then he shared the plan of Vladimir Goguadze, the head of the armored personnel carrier: To break into the enemy's positions and conduct a battle. The battle began at five o'clock in the morning on April 7. An armored train broke into the ranks of the enemy. But the Georgian side did not open fire either from the train or from the trenches, because it had received such an order. Only the artillery, which was handed over to Kargaretli, opened fire on the opponent. Whether the Ottomans approached the train or not, they opened fire. The Georgians opened fire from the train as well as from trenches and trenches. The Ottoman soldiers found in the open field were killed in large numbers. After six hours of the battle, an Ottoman dragster hit the armored car and threw the first car of the train off the tracks, and another attack was made on the armored car by a new thousand from the west. Goguadze had run out of hope and pressed the button with which the armored personnel carrier was supposed to explode, the enemy would only be left with iron fragments, but the wire leading from the remote control to the mine was broken and the mine did not come into action. In the meantime, Akaki Urushadze, who was sent to ask for additional help, came to Mazniashvili and a 400-man detachment of the Gori Guard joined the battle. The Ottomans finally broke and began to retreat. The Georgians came out of the trenches and reached the fleeing enemy to the bridge of Ochkhamuri before 4 o'clock in the day. The Ottoman army retreated 4 kilometers. In the battle, 3 people were killed and 25 wounded on the Georgian side. On the side of the Ottomans, according to Mazniashvili's estimate, up to 500 people were killed, and according to other Georgian military leaders, up to 1000 people were killed. According to Dr. Vakhtang Gambashidze, the Ottomans were transporting 600 wounded soldiers to Batumi. According to ""Georgia"" newspaper, 80 were killed on the Ottoman side, 2 soldiers were captured. Georgians captured 20 rifles."	Georgian Prime Minister Mikhail Mazniashvili has told the BBC that the army's soldiers were killed by Ottoman troops in a battle between the two countries.
" After the release of X&Y (2005), Coldplay decided to build their own recording studio. Chris Martin commented their former workplace ""felt a little dirty"" and the band ""weren't really speaking to each other. We all had our corner office in a big tower block, but there was no vibe"". Furthermore, they bought an old bakery in 2006 to help them refocus and established it as their headquarters. The building is intercalated between ""an estate agent and tiny restaurant"". Will Champion described it as a ""giant version"" of Jonny Buckland's room in Camden Road, from when the group studied at University College London.

 Digging of the shaft began on June 1, 1854, 835 metres from the Saint-Charles shaft, with a section measuring 5.1 metres by 2.5 metres. By September 1856, it had reached a depth of 93.60 metres. The water was drained (20 m3 per hour) using a ten-horsepower steam engine consisting of a horizontal cylinder and gears. This engine was used to drive the pumps and raise the skips of excavated material, while a horse-drawn engine was used to lower the equipment and carry out various manoeuvres. A casing was installed in the rectangular section. At 25.70 metres, the shaft was circular in cross-section and 3.20 metres in diameter. In September 1856, a 12-horsepower direct-drive steam engine accompanied by pumps was ordered from Le Creusot for dewatering; this equipment was operational in June 1857 and sinking resumed. The dewatering machine operated at a rate of seven or eight strokes per minute, but was capable of twelve strokes per minute if necessary. The water was pumped up through sheet metal pipes 24 centimetres in diameter.In May 1858, the installation of the dodecagonal casing, made up of sides 94 centimetres wide and a total height of 98.50 metres, was completed. However, the casing was fragile and eventually began to leak, so a small pump driven by a four-horsepower steam engine was installed 104 metres above the surface in June 1873. It collected between 100 and 120 m3 of water a day in a cofferdam.

 Danny Budd is rejected by the Royal Marines due to his lack of height. An orphan, he lives with his sneering Uncle Fred and oafish cousin Ron in Northern town Tynecastle. Danny works as an underappreciated role as assistant to Fred's coal delivery business, and longs to be a Bootneck like his late father. After being spotted in a scuffle by a Marines recruiting officer, Danny is signed up. While his small stature makes him the butt of jokes his determination and courage soon shine through, especially when defending the barracks from a Luftwaffe raid. Despite further clashes with Fred, Ron and a brash company of Rangers deployed to the town he successfully completes training, and is deployed to the 1942 landings in North Africa. Danny is later selected for SBS missions in the Aegean Sea and fighting along partisans on Crete and in raids in Yugoslavia. Later his unit were selected to work with Soviet marines in the Black Sea, fighting in the Crimea over the winter of 1943. In 1944 he was assigned to special unit Striker Force for the Anzio landings; Danny was injured during the battle and sent on leave in Britain, ending up foiling an escape by German prisoners-of-war. He was later assigned to the Normandy landings force, coming ashore at Juno Beach. Danny fought in the Liberation of Paris and the push to Antwerp. Later in the year he was seconded to the United States Marine Corps, where he made fast friends with Moose Malloy, before being seriously injured fighting the Japanese in Burma in January 1945. After VJ Day, Danny and Moose set up a boxing gym in New York.	The story of a young Scottish soldier who joins the Royal Marines during World War Two is told through the eyes of one of its most memorable characters.
 In 1995, a portion of the archipelago was declared a marine park under the Tanzania Marine parks Authority, a department of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism. The Islands are known as a major breeding ground for whale sharks. At a depth of less than 20 meters below mean tide levels is where more than half of the Mafia Island Marine Park, which has an area of 822 km2, is situated. The bulk of the marine park consists of other reef portions in south Bwejuu Island and the wide area south of the bay surrounded by Mafia, Jibondo, and Juani Islands. A magnificent mosaic of tropical marine ecosystems, including mangrove swamps, coral reefs, and seagrass meadows, may be found in the area. It also supports a huge diversity of fish and other top marine species. Two endangered kinds of sea turtles can find a home in the park. == References ==	In our series of letters from African journalists, Joseph Warungu looks at the Mafia Island Marine Park in Tanzania, which includes the largest coral reefs in the archipelago.
" In 1918, Wimble built a small ship at Hastings with help from a friend and sailed to the West Indies to seek his fortune after his family faced financial hardship. In 1922, he acquired land in the Bahamas which enabled him to begin trading with the English colonies in mainland North America. He also acquired land in North Carolina, which was formally granted to him by George Burrington's council on August 4, 1723. Wimble later moved to Boston, Massachusetts where he married Rebecca Waters, the daughter of a prominent local, on March 26, 1724. Their first son, James, was born on December 20, 1724. He owned land in the South End which he presumably operated as a distillery. While in Boston, he continued his business of moving trade goods between North Carolina and various British trade posts in the West Indies. This business enabled him to increase his land holdings in North Carolina and purchase a brigantine, which he named ""Rebecca"" after his wife. In 1932, Wimble lost his ship and all of its cargo to a hurricane after being forced by Governor Woodes Rogers of the Bahamas to use his ship to protect vessels and salt ponds in Rum Cay. Wimble was forced to sell a portion of his belongings, land, and slaves to cover the loss and began the process of trying to collect damages from Woodes Rogers' commandeering of his ship."

 The cave is located in the Thal-Kittelsthal karst complex, a former Zechstein reef. This region was in a threshold position at the beginning of the Zechstein period; Thuringia was covered by the Zechstein Sea, which had only a shallow water depth in this threshold region. In these shallow water areas, favored by the climatic conditions, many calcareous coral reef found a habitat. These reef-builders died off under increasingly inhospitable living conditions and were gradually covered by sediments of the higher Zechstein. The Thuringian Forest was uplifted by Saxonian fracture block tectonics; to a lesser extent this also affected areas of the foreland such as the Kittelsthal region, parts of which were later eroded again. This provided favorable conditions for karstification. Water sank over fissures and ponors in the reef complex and the dripstone caves began to form. In larger cavities, the dissolution of the limestone by carbonic acid formed stalactites, stalagmites and stalagnates of various sizes and shapes. In the cave there are also sporadic eccentrics, sideways or upward curved outgrowths of a few centimeters in length, independent of gravity.	The Kittelsthal dripstone cave in Thuringia, Germany, is one of the most spectacular examples of karst formation in the world.
 In such conditions, the Seimas of Transcaucasia, at the request of the Abkhazian People's Council, made a decision to restore order in Abkhazia. The chief of staff of the People's Guard, Valiko Jugheli, was appointed as the head of the operation, and General Giorgi Mazniashvili, who at that time was fighting against the Ottoman Empire on the Choloki-Nataneb front, was assigned to separate a detachment to fight against the Bolsheviks in Abkhazia. Colonel Alexander Koniashvili and Alexander Dgebuadze went to Abkhazia together with Valiko Jugheli. Abkhaz princes offered help to the People's Guard, according to one version, it was Tatash Marshania and his squad with 300 horsemen.	The Abkhaz army has been forced to restore order in the early 1990s after a military operation against the Ottoman Empire.

 According to a sakhi, Guru Hargobind once chastised a Sikh for becoming distracted whilst reciting gurbani. Guru Har Rai, the seventh Guru, emphasized the importance of not even changing a single word of gurbani and taught the correct pronunciation of it. In 1706, after the Battle of Muktsar, the army of Guru Gobind Singh camped at Sabo Ki Talwandi, now known as Takht Sri Damdamā Sahib. For nine months, Guru Gobind Singh, Baba Deep Singh, and Bhai Mani Singh scribed an entire volume of the Guru Granth Sahib in a volume known as the Damdama Bir. During this period, Guru Gobind Singh preformed katha of the entirety of the scripture, as well as teaching the proper recitation, or santhiya. This exact bir (copy) was later given the gurgaddi as the 11th Guru of the Sikhs. That year, Guru Gobind Singh is said to have founded a distinguished school of exegesis, later headed up by Baba Deep Singh. Damdamā Sahib was considered to be the highest seat of learning for the Sikhs during the 18th century, and the Damdami Taksal claims direct historical ties to Guru Gobind Singh, who entrusted it with the responsibility of teaching the reading (santhyā), analysis (vichār) of the Sikh scriptures.

 “My works always seem to present a magical, dreamy, and even surreal style and it is because what I want to create is not just a beautiful space, but a spatial experience for visitors.” “Design creates value.” Li Xiang’s work involves the exploration of artistic expression, practicality, and creating new paradigms for futuristic design. The inspiration for her work is derived from her ambition to make the world a better place by making space both a beautiful and spatial experience based on the image of a world she would like to see. It is noted that Li Xiang’s workflow approach is considered unconventional when compared to other architectural practices, where the initial design phase involves mainly working digitally to allow for flexibility and rarely ever on paper.

It is located five kilometers east of downtown Rimouski, and its territory lies entirely within the city of Rimouski, in the Pointe-au-Père sector.The Sainte-Anne River flows through the reserve from east to west. A large part of the reserve is a spartina marsh with several mudflats. The latter is protected from the St. Lawrence River by a rocky headland. The reserve's bedrock is part of the Trois-Pistoles formation. Much of the marsh is flooded during spring and autumn-spring tides. This Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician formation is composed of sandstone, conglomerate, siltstone and slate.	The NWA covers an area of 23.7 ha, including 1.46 ha in the marine environment .

 What was initially reported as sewage was found to be about 1,000 US gallons (3,800 L; 830 imp gal) of a chemical mixture consisting of some sort of organic peroxide. In the first days of the investigation, officials speculated that two inert chemicals accidentally mixed in the truck and created an organic peroxide substance with sulfuric acid appearing to be part of the mix. Organic peroxide combines unstably bound oxygen together with hydrogen and carbon in the same molecule and ignites easily and then burns rapidly and intensely. While field testing was performed on the reactive material for initial identification, the county hazardous materials manager found that laboratories would not test the chemicals over concerns that lab personnel could be injured or their equipment damaged. Three weeks after the incident, the substance was still highly susceptible to friction and seemed to react to something as slight as wind. Sodium chlorite was identified in an internal investigation by the firm in the months following the disaster. They claimed that the chemical was being using as a water treatment agent for the first time and was stored in the same type of storage container as wastewater. The company said they treat about 100 different streams of waste. The owner of facility said that they never had a major problem such as this since the plant only takes non-hazardous waste. The worker combined the chemical with wastewater in the vacuum truck where the chemical interacting with organic material caused an explosion that blew off the back of the truck. A former county district attorney, retained by a company attorney, issued a report in March 2015 that provided an explanation of events indicating that the worker may have accidentally combined the chemicals. Later, investigators found that an inspection by a Defense Logistics Agency contractor was scheduled for that morning and officials of the firm had directed the transfer of these hazardous materials to another location.	A worker combined the chemical with wastewater in the vacuum truck where the chemical interacting with organic material caused an explosion that blew off the back of the truck . Officials speculated that two inert chemicals accidentally mixed in the truck and created an organic peroxide substance with sulfuric acid appearing to be part of the mix .
" In traditional Chinese medicine, several medicinal teas incorporate cash coins as ingredients. This usage of cash coins has been documented as early as the Eastern Jin dynasty, in China's first emergency medicine manual, Zhou hou fang (肘後方).Brass cash coins would first be thoroughly washed before their usage in this process and then boiled in water to produce a type of ""tea"" which was later consumed by the patient. Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine believe that the zinc present in cash coins, which had been leached into the slightly acidic liquid, are said to supposedly promote both healing and the enhancement of the immune system. Meanwhile, bronze cash coins which typically have high concentrations of lead and tin (which in traditional Chinese medicine are said to have the same ""medicinal properties"" as the element mercury), were typically boiled to produce a solution used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of the auris externa. Vietnamese cash coins, which have the highest levels of zinc of any cash coins, were ground up into a powder that was mixed into an aqueous solution or a type of ointment for the treatment of the eyes, ears, and hemorrhoids, or for more topical uses."	Chinese cash coins have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years, according to the National Museum of Chinese Medicine in Beijing.
 Maurice-Mollard Plaza features a monumental, flower-filled fountain at its center, raised on porphyry paving stones. The northern part of the square is embellished with tree-lined avenues, bordering Les Thermes Plaza and the Square du Temple de Diane d'Aix-les-Bains. A grassy area planted with trees and flowers occupies the southern part of the square, in the middle of which stands a staircase giving access to Lord-Revelstoke Avenue (D913). Here, you'll find the Hôtel de Ville square, located above the entrance to the underground parking lot. Several historic monuments are located on and near the square: The Aix-les-Bains town hall, resulting from the redevelopment of a 16th-century château, has been listed as a historic monument since August 7th, 1890 for its staircase, and since December 11th, 1982 for the entire building apart from the north wing. The Temple of Diane in Aix-les-Bains, adjoining the town hall to the northwest, is one of only three classical-style Roman temples to have been completely preserved in France, alongside the Maison Carrée in Nîmes and the Temple of Augustus and Livia in Vienne, and has been listed as a historic monument since 1875. The former national thermal baths of Aix-les-Bains have an entrance on the Maurice-Mollard Plaza side leading to the 913 departmental road. The building has been listed as a historic monument since April 24th, 1986. The Arch of Campanus, a Roman monument dating from the 1st century B.C., has been listed since August 7th, 1890. To the south of the square lies the Thermes floral park, once considered the city's most beautiful promenade. It was listed on April 23th, 2008.

 Danny Budd is rejected by the Royal Marines due to his lack of height. An orphan, he lives with his sneering Uncle Fred and oafish cousin Ron in Northern town Tynecastle. Danny works as an underappreciated role as assistant to Fred's coal delivery business, and longs to be a Bootneck like his late father. After being spotted in a scuffle by a Marines recruiting officer, Danny is signed up. While his small stature makes him the butt of jokes his determination and courage soon shine through, especially when defending the barracks from a Luftwaffe raid. Despite further clashes with Fred, Ron and a brash company of Rangers deployed to the town he successfully completes training, and is deployed to the 1942 landings in North Africa. Danny is later selected for SBS missions in the Aegean Sea and fighting along partisans on Crete and in raids in Yugoslavia. Later his unit were selected to work with Soviet marines in the Black Sea, fighting in the Crimea over the winter of 1943. In 1944 he was assigned to special unit Striker Force for the Anzio landings; Danny was injured during the battle and sent on leave in Britain, ending up foiling an escape by German prisoners-of-war. He was later assigned to the Normandy landings force, coming ashore at Juno Beach. Danny fought in the Liberation of Paris and the push to Antwerp. Later in the year he was seconded to the United States Marine Corps, where he made fast friends with Moose Malloy, before being seriously injured fighting the Japanese in Burma in January 1945. After VJ Day, Danny and Moose set up a boxing gym in New York.	Danny Budd, a former Royal Marine who fought during World War Two in the Black Sea, has died at the age of 75.
 North of Mbuamaji's old town (Currently called Gezaulole), on the seashore, is where the site is situated. A bulldozer has already damaged a portion of the site as of the early 2010s. There is a significant amount of both foreign and native cultural materials at the location. Dutch replicas of Chinese blue and white ceramics from the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as a Chinese blue and white potsherd, are examples of imported items. Other items include glass, red and white beads, Persian pottery, and red pottery from India that has black stripes painted on it. While some of the native pottery was painted in red or graphite, other pieces featured carved embellishments. The decorated ceramics are from the 12th–13th and 15th–16th centuries, respectively. A local potsherd was discovered to feature ornamental designs similar to those from Shungubweni and Pemba Mnazi. The abundance of both indigenous and imported cultural items sets the Mbuamaji site apart from all others north of Pemba Mnazi. Therefore, Mbuamaji ought to have been a very prosperous town. There is a rather modern mosque near the site with inscriptions from AH 1017 (1608 AD). Archaeologist Chittick's early research at the location reveals that the inscriptions were likely brought from another mosque because of the mosque's 19th-century Swahili architectural style. The inscriptions may be from an earlier mosque that once stood on the same spot, according to the updated dates for the location.	The archaeological site of Mbuamaji, in the north-eastern part of Tanzania, is one of the most important archaeological sites in the country.
" Ichikawa Ennosuke IV was born on 26 November 1975, in Tokyo, Japan, into a family with deep connections to the kabuki tradition. He is the son of Ichikawa Danshirō IV, a kabuki actor known for his aragoto style of performances. Ennosuke made his first stage appearance as the child emperor Antoku in the kabuki production Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura at the age of 5. Three years later in 1983, he took the stage name Ichikawa Kamejirō II (二代目 市川 亀治郎, Nidaime Ichikawa Kamejirō). He became known for his tachiyaku and onnagata roles over the course of his career, in addition to his repertoire of dances. Ennosuke made his television debut in 2007 in the taiga drama Fūrin Kazan as Takeda Shingen, from there he began being cast in major supporting roles in high-profile dramas such as Ryōmaden (2010), Naoki Hanzawa (2020), and The 13 Lords of the Shogun (2022). He has also made several film appearances. In 2012, his uncle Kinoshi Masahiko, stage name Ichikawa Ennosuke III, retired from kabuki and passed his appellation to Takahiko, heretofore known as Kamejirō II. From this point on, Takahiko would become known as Ichikawa Ennosuke IV, the fourth in his family to carry the name. Ennosuke IV has carried on his predecessor's mission in revitalizing the art of kabuki to attract contemporary audiences with what's called ""Super Kabuki"" productions, playing a central role in a kabuki reimagining of the manga One Piece (Super Kabuki II: One Piece) that achieved major commercial success."	Ichikawa Ennosuke IV, the fourth in his family to carry the name, has died at the age of 82.

 After the period of Arab rule in Armenia and the South Caucasus, a new period of cultural flourishing began, and active church building was accompanied by new sculptural compositions and solutions. The “first signs” were khachkars (crossstones), which partially continued the tradition of four-sided stelae, forming an original compositional and iconographic system. The period of great and small kingdoms in Armenia, the 9th-11th centuries, was characterized by the formation of several large cultural centers and artistic styles: in Shirak (Shirakavan, Argina, Kars, Ani), Tayk (Ishkhan, Banak, Chordvan, Khakhu), Vaspurakan (Aghtamar), Syunik (Tatev, Bgheno-Noravank). In 915-921 by the order of Gagik Artsruni, the Armenian king of Vaspurakan, one of the unique Armenian monuments, the Church of the Holy Cross on the Aghtamar island was built. The peculiarity of the building was the modest size of the church, the facades of which the architect Manuel managed to decorate with an unprecedented number of sculptures and extensive scenes. The animal types in reliefs are also unprecedented, including fabulous ones. Alternating each other uninterrupted rows of scenes and images of the Aghtamar church seem to be the visual embodiments of the Holy Bible. The monumental images of King Gagik and the deified ancestors of the Artsruni family also found their place in this “Heavenly World”. The 9th-11th centuries Armenian sculpture is rich in images of patrons. On the tympanum of the main entrance of the church of Yerznka (near Ani) (895) were depicted two princes on horseback before the Virgin and Child and accompanied by angels (destroid). In the second half of the 10th century, the high relief figures of the crowned princes Gurgen and Smbat Bagratuni were depicted on the eastern facades of the main churches of Sanahin and Haghpat monasteries (St. Amenaprkich church 966, St. Nshan church 976). And the representatives of the younger branch of Bagratuni (in Tayk), Bagrat and David, were solemnly depicted in Oshkvank (963-973). The compositions of Aghtamar and Oshkvank had direct iconographic correlation to Byzantine imperial images (the mosaic of Constantine and Justinian, St. Sophia, end of the 10th century). And the almost round sculpture of Smbat Bagratuni in Haghpat got its further development in the two-meter statue of King Gagik of Ani, which once decorated the façade of the church of St. Grigor- Gagkashen (1001-1020, architect Trdat). A group of frontal sculptural faces are pre-their unique decorations. That composition consisted of blind arcades extending along the facades of the church and a sculptured “belt” of the Heavenly Garden inhabited by birds, animals, and sometimes with human figures.

" News of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces. The threat of mutiny was rife. Admiral Reinhard Scheer and Ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the ""valour"" of the German Navy. In northern Germany, the German Revolution of 1918–1919 began at the end of October 1918. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost, initiating the uprising. The sailors' revolt, which then ensued in the naval ports of Wilhelmshaven and Kiel, spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918, shortly thereafter to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and to German surrender."

" For a very long time, historians could not trace the ancestry of Vijayalaya Chola, who is considered to be the founder of Medieval Chola dynasty, historians and epigraphists in the wake of Eastern Chalukya king's Copper plate grants, Anbil plates of Parantaka Chola II and Velanjeri plates of Parantaka Chola I believe that Vijayalaya chola might well belong to the Telugu Cholas lineage, who themselves trace their ancestry to the ancient Tamil King, Karikala Chola. Vijayalaya Chola's predecessor is Srikantha Choladhiraja according to Anbil plates of Parantaka Chola II. After mentioning Kochchenganan and his son Nalladikon, Anbil plates has the following verse, ""Srikantha-graha [na]rudha kumkumamka-bhujantarah Srikantha iti-rajendras tat-kuli sam-ajayata"" The above line translates to: In his family was born the chief of kings called Sri Kantha on whose chest were impressed marks of saffron from Lakshmi (Sri)'s embracing his neck. It will be evident from this that Srikantha was not the immediate successor of Nalladikon, but was a descendant of his, born in the family long after.

" The undeclared war between the United Kingdom and Argentina in April 1982 posed a problem for the editorial staff of Battle. While the British response to what was viewed as an invasion of British territory produced a boom in patriotism and interest in warfare, Battle editor Terry Magee, boys' adventure group editor Barrie Tomlinson and managing editor John Sanders ultimately agreed that 'cashing in' on the conflict would be in poor taste. As it was, the fighting concluded on 14 June 1982 and IPC swiftly planned coverage. To maintain decorum over a conflict which had seen 255 British deaths, it was decided to make a documentary-style strip simply recounting the events with no overt fictional elements. Battle co-creator and frequent contributor John Wagner was eager to write the strip, recalling he was ""ready to go"" and ""was all for bashing the Argies"" at the time. Stalwart Jim Watson drew the comic."	The comic was written by Battle co-creator and frequent contributor John Wagner. Jim Watson drew the comic.

 The slow transition from small foraging and hunter/gathering groups to more advanced agricultural societies began four to six thousand years ago in the Amazon Basin, with the exact timing varying by sub-region. These more advanced farming systems involved intensive arboriculture as well as staple root and seed crops that supported stable settlements with relatively large populations. Reports by early European explorers described large “well-fed populations along the bluffs, surrounded by orchards on the uplands and seasonal fields in the floodplains.” As elsewhere in the Americas, the European conquest brought the collapse of indigenous populations and their advanced agricultural systems were largely forgotten. Starting in roughly the year 2000, formal research projects (using molecular data, microfossil botanical techniques, remote sensing, and plant genetics) have resurrected the story of human settlement of the Amazon Basin – it is no longer thought to have been a primeval forest at the time of European contact and can now be considered, along with Mesoamerica, as an “early and independent cradle of agriculture”.The principal features of these agricultural practices are as follows:	The history of human settlement in the Amazon Basin has been largely forgotten since the arrival of European explorers in the 14th Century, according to new research.

 Dūr-Abī-ešuḫ is attested to have been occupied during the reigns of four contiguous rulers of Babylon, Abi-Eshuh, Ammi-Ditana, Ammi-Saduqa and Samsu-Ditana. This period marked the slow decline of the Old Babylonian Empire from the glory days of Hammurabi and the early rise of the First Sealand Dynasty beginning under its first ruler Ilī-ma-AN. Under ruler Samsu-iluna, predecessor of Abi-Eshuh, Babylon lost effective control over Nippur to Ilī-ma-AN and Sealand. Abi-Eshuh fortified the southern region of the Babylonian empire and dammed the Tigris river and as a result full control of Nippur had been regained by his 5th year. It is known that on or about year 11 of the reign of Ammi-Ditana, successor in Babylon to Abi-Eshuh, the major city of Nippur came under attack and was again partially abandoned. Dūr-Abī-ešuḫ was pivotal in the defense of Nippur.	Dūr-Abī-ešuḫ is attested to have been occupied during the reigns of four contiguous rulers of Babylon.

 Both the Flyers and Islanders, two expansion teams established in 1967 and 1972, respectively, saw success and winning early into their franchises histories, something unusual among most expansion franchises in NHL history. By the time the two teams met for their first playoff matchup in the 1975 semifinals, the Flyers had just won the Stanley Cup in the previous season, in just their seventh season of existence. The Islanders were making their first playoff appearance in just their third season of existence. The Islanders had advanced to the semifinals after becoming the second team in NHL history to come back from a 3–0 series deficit, as they defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins in seven games. In the series, the Flyers, the first seed, jumped to a 3–0 series lead over the Islanders. However, the Islanders responded by winning the next three games to force a game seven, but unlike their quarterfinal matchup, they were unable to complete the comeback, as the Flyers prevailed in game seven, 4–1. The Flyers advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals and defeated the Buffalo Sabres to win their second straight Stanley Cup. Both teams would continue to be playoff contenders for the remainder of the decade.	The Philadelphia Flyers and New York Islanders met for the first time in the 1975 Stanley Cup Finals, with the Flyers winning the best-of-seven series, 4-3.

 After gaining independence from the Netherlands, Indonesia claimed all Dutch colonial territories of the Malay Archipelago, including West Papua (formerly Dutch New Guinea). Following a controversial referendum known as the Act of Free Choice, the Papua conflict began as separatists from the Free Papua Movement (OPM) and West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) have conducted a low-intensity guerrilla war against the Indonesian forces, while Indonesia has been accused of conducting a genocidal camphaign against the local indigenous tribes. On 8 September 2021, members of the TPNPB burnt machinery used for the construction of the Trans-Papua Highway. 5 days later, riots broke out in Kiwirok when members of the TPNPB attacked public buildings, including a school and a medical centre, injuring nine people, one of whom later died. This incident was quite unusual for Kiwirok as TPNPB attacks have usually focused on other areas such as Oksibil. As a result, Indonesia has strengthened their military presence in Kiwirok, further intensifying the conflict. This included carrying out several raids during the months of September and October, in which Indonesian security forces took villagers' belongings, and in extreme cases, killed their livestock and even removed roofing from their homes.

 After teenager Ann Somerton's father Andrew is killed during construction of the new Windsor Line for the London Underground, her mother Lilian receives a substantial amount of compensation. Ann, her mother and her mother's new boyfriend - Neville Chandler, who Ann believes is only interested in getting the large insurance pay-out - are invited to join the Mayor's party on the line's maiden train. Passing through a tunnel, Ann sees a vision of her father as one of a gang of ragged workers and faints. This draws the attention of a journalist from the Daily Globe, who begins to investigate. No-one believes her story, but Ann begins dreaming of her father, begging her to help. She returns to the line alone and has another vision, this time seeing her father being beaten by sinister figures. Desperate to find more, she visits her father's old friend Mr. Carstairs, an expert on the Underground, and learns of the old Prince Albert line in the same place decades before, which was covered up after a tunnel collapsed. Meanwhile, the journalist and his photographer venture into the tunnels, only to vanish. Ann spots a photograph of Victorian industrialist Lord Vicary in a magazine, and recognises him as the ringleader in her visions, and - despite her mother's increasingly histrionic attempts to get her to stop her daughter's obsession - returns to the Windsor Line after speaking to Globe editor Franklin, who instigates a police search of the tunnel. However, while Ann sees the two newsmen now among the workers, the police don't. After a spell committed to Stapleton Clinic, Ann pretends there was nothing behind her visions, and requests a visit to Vicary Hall, now a stately home that allows guided tours. She discovers Vicary conducted secretive botanical experiments and had a dim view of the growing worker's rights movement before disappearing in the Prince Albert Line disaster. Ann is later able to return to the Windsor Line in secret, but is accosted by the demonic Vicary before escaping with the help of an Underground worker. She follows them back to the ruins of the Albert Line. Using his botany research, Vicary and his right-hand thug Brock have prolonged their own lives and kidnapped her father and his workmates as well as others to build them an underground town. Ann is captured too, and finds Vicary is using drugs to keep control. With the aid of Vicary's abused maid Lucy, Ann is able to get to her father. The police meanwhile are drilling in the Underground as they search for Ann, having found a picture taken by the photographer that corroborates her story. Falling masonry kills Vicary as he prepares to attack Ann. The captives are freed, while those exposed to Vicary's drug are found an island where they can live, with the government covering the incident up so they can live in peace. Andrew returns to his family, sending Neville packing, and Ann has her father back.	Ann Somerton's father Andrew is killed during construction of the new Windsor Line for the London Underground .

 In 2016, Garcia founded the party called Prodinculous/Procitizen advocating for the protection of entrepreneurial freedom and the preservation of individuals' rights to private ownership. Garcias has voiced his belief as the surveys indicate that Venezuelans are in favor of Free Enterprise, economic freedom, dialogue, and women's rights. He was disqualified from running for the mayor of Caracas, a decision he publicly denounced. In 2019, he traveled to the United States and met with Mauriceo Clever and various officials in the Donald Trump administration. During this time, he emphasized the need for a unity government between the opposition and the Chavista government as the solution for Venezuela's political problems. Ten deputies who were previously members of the parliamentary block of the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) in the National Assembly (AN) from Un Nuevo Tiempo and other parties resigned from their parties and joined García's political movement. Garcia announced that his party would field a candidate in the 2024 Venezuelan presidential election.	Un Nuevo Tiempo, a political party in Venezuela, was founded by Guillermo García, a former mayor of Caracas.
 Pieces tend to be large, with multi-coloured fills and outlines. They often incorporate highlights and a background, and may use extensions, 3D effects, and sometimes characters.Because of their complexity and large size, pieces usually take a significant amount of time to plan and paint and therefore are often found on legal walls. Illegal pieces tend to be found in less crowded spaces such as train yards, tunnels, drains, rooftops, and walls facing train tracks. Illegal pieces done in busier areas are often done over multiple nights or by mutiple members of a crew. Many people unfamiliar with graffiti forms can find it difficult to distinguish the letters in more elaborate pieces. While straight-letters are pieces with clear letters that prioritise legibility, wildstyle pieces have extremely exaggerated letters forms with multiple extensions and add-ons, and are often illegible to many people. This may be a deliberate choice to allow only those familiar with the art form to read them. Some writers choose to sign their pieces with personal and crews.	Wildstyle graffiti is a more complex form of the art form that has been popular in the UK since the 1970s and is often found on walls and rooftops.
" Bavaria was born in 1957 to Elizabeth ""Janee"" Swank and Edward Bavaria in Little Rock, Arkansas. His father worked as a pilot for the United States Airforce until he started working for General Electric in 1962. Bavaria attended a Cincinnati kindergarten school until third grade. Then, his family moved first to Dallas, Texas and then to Bonn, Germany where they lived from 1967 to 1970. In Germany, his father worked with the embassy thanks to a public-private partnership between General Electric and the German Airforce. Bavaria attended the American School on the Rhine. In 1970, his father was promoted to Head of Engine Division in Europe at General Electric and the family moved to Paris before returning to Cincinnati four years later in 1974. Bavaria graduated from the Indian Hill High School. He attended Tulane University as an underdraguate and spent a year as an honors exchange student in Edinburgh, Scotland. He graduated with honors from Tulane University in 1979 with a degree in chemical engineering and then attended Tulane University School of Medicine. During his years at Tulane's Medical School, he had an externship in cardiac and thoracic surgery in Cincinnati where he decided to pursue a career in cardiothoracic surgery. He graduated from Tulane's Medical School and was awarded the ""Gold Scalpel Award"", the highest surgery honor for a medical student.

" Sharma's first ascent of Es Pontàs featured prominantly in the award-winning 2007 climbing film, King Lines, which became an iconic film in rock climbing. Images of Sharma soloing on the dramatic and overhanging arch above deep blue sea, adorned the covers of most climbing magazines, showcasing DWS to the global climbing community. In 2016, Rock & Ice said: ""The silhouette of Sharma on the underside of the Es Pontàs arch is an indelible image for climbers of the mid-2000s"". In a 2016 interview with Climbing, when DWS pioneer Miquel Riera was asked about the most impressive DWS ascent, he replied: ""Have you seen Chris Sharma on Es Pontàs? That should answer your question"".Sharma said of his ascent: ""... definitely a pivotal experience in my life that set me on an entirely new path in my life and in the world"". He also said: ""... deep water soloing embodies for me the perfect form of climbing. Take Es Pontàs for instance, it’s a route I put up in Mallorca. It's 5.15, but I can solo it. For me, that's as good as it gets"". Climbing considered his ascent of Es Pontàs as being another example of Sharma's talent for ""... the genius to see the potential, coupled with the commitment to spend months and years of his life proving it"". Climbing also noted that the ascent, and increased profile Sharma brought to DWS, as being another example of his influence on the development of the sport of modern rock climbing, saying: ""Sharma shaped modern rock climbing. Whatever he thought was cool, we followed. Bouldering. Projecting hard sport routes. Deep water soloing""."	"Chris Sharma's ascent of Es Pontàs, one of the most famous routes in the DWS, has been described as ""one of the greatest solo ascents in DWS history""."
 Fruit production: Fruit production is a major driver of deforestation around the world. In tropical countries, forests are often cleared to plant fruit trees, such as bananas, pineapples, and mangoes. This deforestation is having a number of negative environmental impacts, including: Biodiversity loss: Forests are home to a wide variety of plant and animal species, many of which are found nowhere else in the world. Deforestation is threatening these species with extinction. Ecosystem disruption: Forests play a vital role in regulating the environment. They help to absorb rainwater, prevent flooding, and mitigate climate change. Deforestation can disrupt these important ecosystem services. Land degradation: When forests are cleared, the soil is often left exposed to erosion. This can lead to land degradation, which can make it difficult to grow crops.

Out of the 28 pillars, there are 12 pillars which are sculpted in a manner which can produce musical notes when struck. Tamil poet says that the pillars here are a combination of the Shruti Gana Laya types. The Mandapam has beautiful architectural representations of various forms of Vishnu and few scenes of Ramayana, Mahabharatha and Srimad Bhagavatham. There are separate shrines for Sudarshana Perumal, Alvars, Hanuman, Garuda and Andal.	A temple in the northern Indian state of Tamil Nadu has been built by the Hindus during the war of the 1970s.
" The show had a mixed critical reception, with the acting being praised, but the plotting criticised. In a four-star review of the first four episodes, The Guardian's Luke Buckmaster said that it took him time to ""get accustomed to The Messenger's idiosyncratic rhythms, but soon I relished returning to this world"", noting a ""strange alchemy between setting and character"", with ""lean and uncluttered"" plotting. He praised the directors and screenwriters for ""deftly balanc[ing] comedy and drama, creating a subtle and strange quirkiness"", and for ""trust[ing] in the nature and strength of the story and the cast, allowing scenes to breathe while keeping things progressing at a good pace"", as well as the efforts by the programme's cinematographer to ensure ""retro flavour is baked into the show's aesthetic"". TV Tonight's David Knox, in a three-and-a-half star review of the first two episodes, said the series ""effectively asks you to leave your logic at the door and go with its heightened mix of drama, dark comedy and magic realism"", praising McKenna as a ""likeable lead"", and that the series impressed upon him an attempt by ABC to appeal to younger viewers, doubtful it ""will connect with core ABC viewers, and perhaps it might be best framed as premium YA content"". Mel Campbell, for ScreenHub, was more critical. In a two-and-a-half star review of the first four episodes, she opined that the series ""often seems to deliberately withhold sense-making from the audience in pursuit of its air of mystery"", and found the series flipping between what she saw as ""realist drama or magical realism"", and inconsistent motivations of the characters, as exasperating, yet nevertheless said ""the cast do their best with this flawed material""."	Critics have given their reactions to The Messenger, which has been released for the first time in more than a decade.
" As a result, in September 1986 the family-owned Nattermann company was sold to the French chemical and pharmaceutical group Rhône-Poulenc. In December 1999, the latter merged with Hoechst AG to form a new company called Aventis, which in turn was acquired by Sanofi in December 2004. Since then, Nattermann has belonged to Sanofi. Under the direction of Sanofi, Nattermannallee today employs 440 people producing 100 million packages of medicines annually. Nattermann manufactures around 15% of its products for the German market, 85% are exported worldwide, especially to France.The administrative building was transferred to the biotechnology park ""BioCampus Cologne"" in April 2002, where Nattermann continues to be headquartered.

" While awaiting trial, Snowden was housed in the Ada County jail. On September 28, 1956, Snowden asked for and received a court-appointed attorney. On October 5, 1956, he pleaded not guilty to the charges. However, on October 18, 1956, he changed his plea to guilty. After verifying that Snowden understood his guilty plea waived his right to a trial by jury and could lead to a life sentence or an execution, Judge M. Oliver Koelsch scheduled a hearing for October 23 to determine the degree of murder Snowden committed, as well as a punishment. The court ultimately determined that Snowden's crime was a first-degree murder and that there were no mitigating circumstances they could identify to justify reducing his punishment, so on October 26, Snowden was sentenced to death. His death sentence was initially scheduled to be carried out on December 7, 1956, but Snowden's lawyer filed a notice of appeal on his behalf, causing the initial execution date to be automatically delayed. In his appeal, Snowden argued that Dean's murder did not meet the criteria of a first-degree murder because he did not exhibit ""malice aforethought."" Snowden's attorney also requested a commutation of Snowden's sentence based on purported mental illness, as well as based on the argument that the crime more closely resembled second-degree murder or manslaughter, rather than first-degree murder, and that the death penalty was a disproportionately harsh punishment. In a unanimous opinion, the Idaho Supreme Court rejected Snowden's appeal. In September 1957, Judge Koelsch set Snowden's execution date for October 18, 1957."

 The model of the Chinese Mongolian is the same as that of the Mongolian horse. It is considered locally as a horse because of this model and not as a pony. The head has a rectilinear profile and is rather heavy, with a broad forehead, open nostrils, protruding eyes, and long ears. The neck is short and muscular, the chest deep, the shoulder fairly sloping and muscular. The withers are not very prominent; the back is short, solid, and straight. The croup is long and sloping. The legs are short, strong, and solid. The breed is renowned for its solid constitution. The average height is 1.28 m, 1.27 m for mares, and 1.30 m for males. Weight ranges from 300 to 360 kg, with an average of 360 for males and 300 for females. There are variations according to type. For example, the University of Oklahoma study, dating from 2007, gives a size range from 1.21 to 1.42 m, and CAB International, in its study published in 2016, 1.22 to 1.42 m. Size increases markedly when environmental conditions are favorable.	The Chinese Mongolian horse is a large horse with a long neck and a short back, with a well-developed body and a solid constitution.
 Currently, the Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo forest is a large natural area and one of the largest recreational areas in the North West of Moscow along with Serebryany Bor. A linden park is on the north side of the manor house. Some very old trees have also been preserved there. The park has a variety of tree types, including pines, maples, larches, lindens, oaks, birchs, elms, cedars, spruces, and apple trees. Many local residents frequently visit the ponds located in the eastern part of the park. There is a beach area around a large pond, with some trees. The northern and northwestern parts of the park were created relatively recently where a mixed forest originally was. The layout has a system of paths. The northwestern natural boundary of the park is the Khimka River, the only clean source of drinking water in Moscow as of 2009. The spring has several water pipes, where residents of neighboring and remote areas can collect clean drinking water. The spring had a mosaic panel depicting a swan princess that was destroyed after updates were made to the spring.

 On January 30, 2012, the Osisko Mining Corporation announced that they would suspend exploration activities due to “community protests and media reports and requests.”In a press release, Osisko denied claims of a “mega-mining” project, and explained that the project is not a mining project, but an exploration project at this point. The press release stated: “If there is no social license for exploration and development around the Famatina project area, no work will be conducted.” Osisko also stressed their commitment to socially and environmentally sound exploration methods. They are planning a community consultation program and hope to reassure residents of Famatina about the potential environmental and economic impacts a mining project in their area could have. == References ==	The Osisko mining company has suspended exploration activities around the Famatina project area in the Highlands after a row over environmental laws.
 In 2006, a photo of an unidentified, large, monocarpic, fan palm in Madagascar was posted on PalmTalk, the society’s online forum. This photo led botanists to the site and to the discovery and description of a monotypic genus new to science, Tahina, which was published in 2008. The PalmTalk community subsequently spearheaded a drive to raise funds for its conservation. In 2020, the IPS launched its annual Save the Species campaign to raise awareness and funding for targeted palm conservation projects around the world.

 In July 2022, the conflict in Blue Nile State flared up in the Wad el-Mahi locality due to a land dispute that erupted between the Hausa on one side, and Berta and Funj on the other. The violence in July was partially triggered by these land conflicts and aggravated by political rivalries. This resurgence of violence follows an earlier outbreak in mid-July, where intercommunal clashes claimed numerous lives and forced thousands to flee to safer areas. The conflict's humanitarian impact has been severe, with approximately 235,000 individuals displaced and seeking refuge in makeshift shelters, including schools and nearby camps. The closure of markets due to the ongoing violence has left local residents struggling to meet their basic needs, while government offices remain shuttered.The clashes have led to protests across Sudan, particularly among the Hausa community, who are demanding justice for the victims. These protests have also shed light on issues of racism and marginalisation, as the Hausa community in Sudan, part of the Hausa ethnic group from West Africa, have been perceived as outsiders in Sudan. == References ==	The present invention describes a system and method for preventing intercommunal violence in U.S., and in particular describes a system and method for preventing intercommunal violence in U.S., and in particular describes a system and method for preventing intercommunal violence in U.S., and in particular describes a system and method for preventing intercommunal violence in U.S., and in particular describes a system and method for preventing intercommunal violence in U.S., and in particular describes a system and method for preventing intercommunal violence in U.S., and in particular describes a system and method for preventing
 In the men's championship division finals, the 2000 champions, Penn State, would face North Carolina in their national finals debut. While all of Penn State's previous 5 games were within a goal, North Carolina would cut it much closer, requiring extra time in their previous two games, including a nine-round penalty shootout with Illinois in the semifinals. Despite playing nearly 30 extra minutes, North Carolina started early with a goal from Eric Rossitch in the 5th minute off of a header near the 6-yard box off of a free kick. A goal in the last minute by Daniel Goff while Penn State had all 11 men in North Carolina's half would see North Carolina win 2–0. This was North Carolina's first national title and the first national title by a Region II team, the only region who hadn't had a team claim a men's championship national title. In the women's championship finals, the 2012 champions, Michigan State, would face Colorado State who were looking on claiming their fourth national title. Both teams required extra time in the semifinals and Colorado State further needed penalty kicks to decide not only the semifinals, but also the quarterfinals. Following the trend for both teams, the game would remain 0-0 after 80 minutes, meaning extra time would be required. Four minutes into extra time, eventual MVP Danielle Manning of Michigan State would break the deadlock with a sudden-victory goal that gave Michigan State their second women's national title. Both of Michigan State's titles were won in extra time. In the men's open finals, Oregon would return to the open finals after their title 10 years ago in 2005 to face UC-Davis who were making their debut. Coming in, Oregon won each of their previous 5 games by at least 2 goals while UC-Davis had only given up a single goal. UC-Davis would go up 2–1 in the match, but Oregon's Henry Fassinger would score a penalty kick late into the game to tie the game at 2-2, forcing the game into extra time. Eventual MVP, Andrew Saenz of Oregon, would score a sudden-victory goal to secure Oregon's 3–2 win and their second national title.In the women's open finals, 2012 open champions, JMU, would face last year's open runners-up UCLA. Coming in, JMU would require a penalty shootout in the quarterfinals while UCLA required extra time in the semifinals. UCLA would redeem their finals loss the previous year and defeat JMU 2–0, claiming their second open title. Isis Piccillo of UCLA would be named MVP.	2000 champions, Penn State, would face North Carolina in their national finals debut.

" El Velorio depicts a traditional 19th-century baquiné or velorio del angelito (""wake of a little angel""), a specific type of wake with origins in Afro-Puerto Rican culture that was celebrated by jibaros and other countrymen as funerary celebrations for the death of a child. This practice originates in the syncretic Catholic and folk belief that the death of an innocent baptized child results in their automatic ascension and entrance into Heaven and that the occasion is therefore a cause not only for remembrance but for celebration. The baquiné in this portrait depicts the deceased child as a focal point dressed in white and adorned with flowers, lying on a table at the center of a traditional countryside house. The iconography of the child, reminiscent of a Christ Child, symbolizes his purity and innocence but also presents a lighter theme that separates the painting into two visual contrasts: one lighter in colors that depicts scenes of joy and celebration with food and music, and another with darker colors and shadows that depicts not only the sorrow of the child's parents but also a chaotic scene of a priest trying to perform wake rites while dogs are running around. This exemplifies the everyday clash between life and death, and between celebration and suffering, common in the life of poor countrymen in 19th-century Puerto Rico. The scene is intentionally portrayed as a judgmental satire, with Francisco Oller himself describing the scene as “an orgy of brutish appetites under the guise of gross superstition."""

" Andrews returned to his education in 1994. He pursued a PhD in chemistry at Stanford University under the direction of Steven Boxer, which he completed in 2001. His research focused on the effects of electric fields on molecular vibrations, called the vibrational Stark effect, which he investigated with infrared spectroscopy. In the process, he developed a liquid nitrogen immersion cryostat and novel FTIR scanning methods. After earning his PhD, Andrews switched fields to systems biology. This started with post-doctoral research in Dennis Bray's laboratory at the University of Cambridge (2001-2003), where he investigated spatial aspects of cell signaling. As part of this work, he developed a spatially detailed biochemical simulator called Smoldyn, a project that has continued to be a major part of his career. Andrews followed this position with several others: more post-doctoral research in Adam Arkin's laboratory at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (2003-2007), a visiting scientist position at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (2007), a staff scientist position at the Molecular Sciences Institute (2008-2009), a staff scientist position in Roger Brent's laboratory at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (2009-2016), a physics teaching position at Seattle University (2015-2020), and his current scientist position in Herbert Sauro's laboratory at the University of Washington (2020-). Andrews's research has continued to focus on algorithm and software development for spatially detailed biochemical modeling, including particle, filament, and surface dynamics. His software, Smoldyn, is used for biophysics and cell modeling research. Andrews has also worked on non-spatial biochemical models. For example, in work with Roger Brent, he found that symmetric ""push-pull"" reaction mechanisms are able to make biochemical signaling outputs depend linearly on their inputs."	Scientist Herbert Sauro has been appointed scientist at the University of Washington, where he has spent more than 20 years working on physics.
" In the Rocky Mountain Range area of the Western United States, powder skiing is a common term used among expert skiers. Alf Engen, an early contributor to constructing 27 ski resorts in the Rocky Mountain Range, is known as the pioneer of powder skiing. The skiing public at Alta Ski Resort first discovered the secret bliss of deep powder in the 1940s. Located in Salt Lake County Utah, Alta Ski Resort is also known for its deep powder skiing and its reputation for having ""the greatest snow on earth"", Utah's slogan.A fall line when skiing is the diagonal line down the slope at which a skier would obtain the most momentum, due to the force of gravity. Powder skiing and general skiing techniques such as the Alberg technique can be categorized by the fall line."

" The Ius in Memoria are akin to Ius in Bello, in focusing more on the ""how"" of commemoration. It has four criteria: Transcend the Collectives. Commemoration is seen as ethical if it encourages people to treat each other as individuals rather than group representatives. Exit Circular Narratives. Commemoration should help people exit narratives that trap them in debilitating interpretative loops. Assert Moral Autonomy. Groups should justify their actions in universal terms, rather than excusing transgressions with reference to what others have done. Contained Unfathomability. Good commemoration should be precise with dates, locations and names to tether past trauma. Numerical aspects of trauma should typically be communicated in broad categories. Proponents of the approach argue that taken together, the framework can constitute a comprehensive ethical approach or paradigm for commemoration. They concede that critiques of the just war tradition also apply to this moral framework, in that both pacifist and realist/revolutionary alternatives retain their validity."	In our series of letters from African journalists, Ius in Memoria is a controversial approach to commemoration. Here, we look at how it works.
 The sculpture consist of two sphinxes, with the left missing its head. Found in fragments initially, the stele was broken from side to side, along with the forelegs, which were subsequently repaired. The lower portion is decorated with a frieze of palmettes, egg, and dart, characteristic of 5th century BC style, with portions of the stele maintaining its original polychromy with red-brown pigment. Both sphinxes are faced back to back, gazing out in three-quarters perspective. The intact sphinx has its hair intact and long, pulled back on the sides, but covering her ears, and wears a crown consisting of circles and merlons, the back of the stele is roughed out with its bottom half broken off. The sphinx motif on the stele indicates it's prominence in cult objects, as prior to the stele's approximate creation, in the mid 5th century BC, the depiction was also seen in the Amathus sarcophagus, considered the most significant object in the Cesnola collection alongside the stele, famous for its preserved polychromy. == References ==	A sculpture of a 5th century ancient sten which was discovered in the Vatican in July has been unveiled.
 This dish lends itself to many variations and is sometimes confused with Syracuse sauce (because of the presence of anchovies), the original recipe of which, however, often uses short pasta and does not involve the use of breadcrumbs, but rather a generous amount of vegetables, capers and olives; these are foods that are not present in the traditional recipe of this dish, with the rare exception of olives, which are black. It should also not be confused with the first course, especially in Palermo, called pasta with sardines: although tradition says it was born in the Syracuse area (but by cooks of the Arab army, camped there to conquer the city), it is quite distant from the culinary customs of the Syracuse area, considering ingredients such as raisins and pine nuts (a classic combination of Palermo cuisine), as well as saffron, and the fish that dominates the dish is sardine, not anchovy. The toasted breadcrumbs in the original pasta with sardines are not present.	This dish lends itself to many variations and is sometimes confused with sauce.
 The building has three levels, developing on a rectangular floor plan 40 m long and 13 m wide. On the east front, it has a columned portico developed on five round arches, placed asymmetrically, with a wooden trussed ceiling. The top floor consists of a loggia extending across the entire surface of the villa, covered by wooden trusses supporting the roof pitches. A cross-vaulted cellar extends only partially over a square portion of the roof. The only vertical connection prior to the 20th century restoration (which saw the introduction of a three-flight internal staircase) was the external staircase in the forepart at the end of the southern façade. Some frescoes preserved inside the ladies' room constitute a very rare example of the depiction of the leisure and occupations of the ladies of the court: they depict moments of the mistress's day, from waking up accompanied by music, to playing chess, to preparing the nuptial bed.

 Alongwith many classic shloka from Bhagvad Gita, the following shloka has a great significance:- Following is the English translation of the shloka:- O Arjuna! You have the right to perform your own duty! But you should not be concerned about it's outcomes. Never be motivated by the results of your actions, nor should you be attached to not performing your prescribed duties. The shloka was widely used in India. It was the introductory theme song of BR Chopra's B.R. Films. The shloka was used in S.S. Rajamouli's 2022- Telugu Movie RRR, by Ram Charan. Furthermore, the shloka was widely used at different times and by many politicians in India. Prominent Indian Independence Movement leader, Mahatma Gandhi's interpretation of the Sankhya Yoga chapter in the Bhagavad Gita revolved around selfless action, non-attachment, and the concept of duty. He believed that individuals should focus on performing their responsibilities without being attached to the results.

 Pieces tend to be large, with multi-coloured fills and outlines. They often incorporate highlights and a background, and may use extensions, 3D effects, and sometimes characters. Because of their complexity and large size, pieces usually take a significant amount of time to plan and paint and therefore are often found on legal walls. Illegal pieces tend to be found in less crowded spaces such as train yards, tunnels, drains, rooftops, and walls facing train tracks. Illegal pieces done in busier areas are often done over multiple nights or by mutiple members of a crew. Many people unfamiliar with graffiti forms can find it difficult to distinguish the letters in more elaborate pieces. While straight-letters are pieces with clear letters that prioritise legibility, wildstyle pieces have extremely exaggerated letters forms with multiple extensions and add-ons, and are often illegible to many people. This may be a deliberate choice to allow only those familiar with the art form to read them. Some writers choose to sign their pieces with personal and crews.

 The village of Tanuševci became involved in conflict on 17 February 2001, when masked NLA militants entered the area and kidnapped a TV filming crew. In response, Macedonian police attempted to enter the village on the same day but were met with fierce gunfire from the NLA militants, sparking the beginning of the battle in the village. On February 26, 2001, Macedonian forces engaged in battle with the NLA that lasted for several hours. Ultimately, the Macedonian forces succeeded in forcing the NLA to retreat across the border into Kosovo. Shortly after their retreat to Kosovo, the NLA made another attempt to gain control over the village once more and as of 1 March 2001, the NLA expelled the Macedonian forces and established control over Tanuševci.	The battle of Tanuševci was one of the most violent clashes between the Macedonian army and the National Liberation Army (NLA) in Kosovo.
" In 2011, The Alaska Design Forum, in collaboration with the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), embarked on a public art project that aimed to ignite conversations about shared spaces. This project resulted in a giant banner with the words ""Looking For Love Again"" hanging on the west face of the Polaris Building. The project sought to engage the public in a meaningful way and was designed by Candy Chang, a graphic and urban designer known for her work in struggling communities. The project featured two chalkboards at the base of the building, inviting passersby to share their memories and hopes related to the Polaris Building. Drawing inspiration from a similar endeavor in New Orleans, Candy Chang sought to evoke a sense of community ownership and empowerment by encouraging individuals to articulate their desires for their neighborhood. The 40 by 80-foot ""Looking For Love Again"" banner was vandalized and cut down in the summer of 2014."

 The slow transition from small foraging and hunter/gathering groups to more advanced agricultural societies began four to six thousand years ago in the Amazon Basin, with the exact timing varying by sub-region. These more advanced farming systems involved intensive arboriculture as well as staple root and seed crops that supported stable settlements with relatively large populations. Reports by early European explorers described large “well-fed populations along the bluffs, surrounded by orchards on the uplands and seasonal fields in the floodplains.” As elsewhere in the Americas, the European conquest brought the collapse of indigenous populations and their advanced agricultural systems were largely forgotten. Starting in roughly the year 2000, formal research projects (using molecular data, microfossil botanical techniques, remote sensing, and plant genetics) have resurrected the story of human settlement of the Amazon Basin – it is no longer thought to have been a primeval forest at the time of European contact and can now be considered, along with Mesoamerica, as an “early and independent cradle of agriculture”.The principal features of these agricultural practices are as follows:	The United States is undergoing a transition from small foraging and hunter/gathering groups to more advanced agricultural societies with intensive arboriculture as well as staple root and seed crops that supported stable settlements with relatively large populations.
 Fruit production: Fruit production is a major driver of deforestation around the world. In tropical countries, forests are often cleared to plant fruit trees, such as bananas, pineapples, and mangoes. This deforestation is having a number of negative environmental impacts, including: Biodiversity loss: Forests are home to a wide variety of plant and animal species, many of which are found nowhere else in the world. Deforestation is threatening these species with extinction. Ecosystem disruption: Forests play a vital role in regulating the environment. They help to absorb rainwater, prevent flooding, and mitigate climate change. Deforestation can disrupt these important ecosystem services. Land degradation: When forests are cleared, the soil is often left exposed to erosion. This can lead to land degradation, which can make it difficult to grow crops.	Deforestation is one of the biggest environmental threats in the world, according to a new report from the Environment Agency.
 Both the Flyers and Islanders, two expansion teams established in 1967 and 1972, respectively, saw success and winning early into their franchises histories, something unusual among most expansion franchises in NHL history. By the time the two teams met for their first playoff matchup in the 1975 semifinals, the Flyers had just won the Stanley Cup in the previous season, in just their seventh season of existence. The Islanders were making their first playoff appearance in just their third season of existence. The Islanders had advanced to the semifinals after becoming the second team in NHL history to come back from a 3–0 series deficit, as they defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins in seven games. In the series, the Flyers, the first seed, jumped to a 3–0 series lead over the Islanders. However, the Islanders responded by winning the next three games to force a game seven, but unlike their quarterfinal matchup, they were unable to complete the comeback, as the Flyers prevailed in game seven, 4–1. The Flyers advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals and defeated the Buffalo Sabres to win their second straight Stanley Cup. Both teams would continue to be playoff contenders for the remainder of the decade.	The Flyers and Islanders were two expansion teams established in 1967 and 1972, respectively.

 “My works always seem to present a magical, dreamy, and even surreal style and it is because what I want to create is not just a beautiful space, but a spatial experience for visitors.” “Design creates value.” Li Xiang’s work involves the exploration of artistic expression, practicality, and creating new paradigms for futuristic design. The inspiration for her work is derived from her ambition to make the world a better place by making space both a beautiful and spatial experience based on the image of a world she would like to see. It is noted that Li Xiang’s workflow approach is considered unconventional when compared to other architectural practices, where the initial design phase involves mainly working digitally to allow for flexibility and rarely ever on paper.

 In December of that year, They crossed the Heilong River and were stationed in the Russian Free City Srabske area. With the help of 500,000 Koreans and the Russian Red Army, they received weapons replenishment and sometimes participated in joint operations. Meanwhile, in February 1921, a military agreement was signed between the buffer government in Chita and the anti-Japanese independence army through the good offices of Ohamuk, a graduate of the Russian Military Academy who participated in the Russian Revolution. According to this military agreement, the independence army received weapons from them, established the Goryeo Revolutionary Military Academy (高麗革命軍官學校) to train the independence army, and participated in the subjugation of the Baekgye Army. Knowing this, Japan launched a robust diplomatic offensive against the Russian government and demanded that it disarm. Meanwhile, Russia, anxious about domestic civil war after the revolution, was wary of discord with Japan and promised to disarm the Korean Independence Army. Accordingly, on June 22, 1921, the Russian authorities issued an order to the Korean independence forces stationed in Heilongjiang Jayu City to disarm and, at the same time, attack and defeat the resisting independence forces, causing the Jayu City Incident. At this time, the Independence Army units suffered many casualties and suffered untold hardships, causing the Korean Independence Corps to disintegrate.	The Korean independence army was once a military force, but in the 1920s, it was the largest armed forces in China.

 The Fifth Circuit analyzed whether Bitcoin transaction records are protected by the Fourth Amendment. The court likened Bitcoin transactions to bank records, which are not protected by the Fourth Amendment under the third-party doctrine. This doctrine holds that a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties. The court ruled that Gratkowski voluntarily disclosed information about his Bitcoin transactions to third parties (i.e., all users globally of the Bitcoin network and Coinbase), and therefore he had no reasonable expectation of privacy in this information. Affirming the district court's denial of Gratkowski's motion to suppress the evidence, the court ruled that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in Bitcoin transaction records on the blockchain or held by a third-party exchange like Coinbase, thus such records are not protected by the Fourth Amendment. The case was decided by a panel consisting of Circuit Judges Carl E. Stewart, James L. Dennis, and Catharina Haynes, with Judge Haynes delivering the opinion of the court.	A US federal appeals court has ruled in favour of Bitcoin exchange Coinbase in a case brought by a Massachusetts man, John Gratkowski, against the company.
" Compared to Southeastern China, the Dongbei or Northeast region of China was settled by Han Chinese relatively recently, only in the past 200 years or so, during a migration movement referred to as Chuang Guandong. Jia Xingjia, a Chinese essayist, compared this expansion to the Western Expansion of the United States, in which the Northeast was seen by China as a sort of cultural blank slate. Many of these migrants abandoned their hometowns and left behind their folk traditions and languages. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Northeast was an industrial hotbed of China. State-owned industrial operations guaranteed lifetime employment to blue-collar workers, the ""iron rice bowl."" During this time, it was the most urbanized area of China, and boasted the country's most extensive rail network. Communities were organized around factories which provided not just employment, but also a community to their workers, such as in state-owned cultural palaces, which could serve as movie theaters, libraries, chess rooms, and stadiums, among other roles. These palaces and their decline are a common element of Dongbei renaissance works, and could be seen as a communist analogue to the capitalist dead mall: a once-vibrant physical community center that has become outmoded with economic decline and the rise of Internet-based communities. Economic reforms in 1990s China led to privately-owned businesses outcompeting state enterprises. Corruption and increased competition caused state-owned manufacturing plants to decline, and their employees were laid off en masse. The resulting economic depression in these areas created urban decay. The northeast, more so than other regions, was both economically and culturally enmeshed with the Communist state. As a result, it struggled to adapt to a liberalized China."	The northeast of China has become a once-vibrant physical community centre, which could be associated with the collapse of the Communist state.
 The Dunstan Mountains form the entrance to the Upper Clutha Valley. The northwest flank of the range is bound by a combination of Cluden Stream in the Lindis Valley, the Lindis River, the Clutha River (Māori: Mata-Au) and Lake Dunstan. Lake Dunstan follows the former Clutha River through the Cromwell Gorge demarcating the southwest limit of the mountains. The mountain range is bound to the east by the Manuherikia Valley and to the northeast by Dunstan Creek, which joins the Manuherikia River at Saint Bathans. The Dunstan Mountains are bisected by the 4-wheel drive Thomson Gorge Road which follows Thomsons Creek, incised into the eastern flank of the range and the Rise and Shine Creek on the western flank. Thomsons Saddle, between the two creeks, climbs to 980 m (3,220 ft) elevation. The summit landscape is generally a broad, gently sloping undulatory surface which climbs steadily from the west and falls sharply to the Manuherakia Valley floor on the east. The asymmetric nature of the Dunstan Mountains is common with most of Central Otago's basin and range mountains.	The Dunstan Mountains form the entrance to the Upper Clutha Valley.

" In poem 3.13 Sulpicia calls herself ""Sulpicia daughter of Servius"" (Servi filia Sulpicia), and in poem 3.13 she addresses Messalla (presumably Tibullus's patron Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, consul in 31 BC) as propinque ""relative"". On this basis Haupt (1871) identified Sulpicia as the granddaughter of Cicero's friend, Servius Sulpicius Rufus (consul 51 BC), who died in 43 BC, whose son is said to have married Messalla's sister. If so, Sulpicia would have been Messalla's niece. Some scholars write that she was Servius Sulpicius Rufus's daughter; if so, this would make Messalla her brother-in-law. Cērinthus, from the Greek κήρινθος ""bee bread"", is thought to be a synonym. Because of the similarity of consonants (c, r, n, t), as well as the metrical equivalence of the two names, and the resemblance between Greek κέρας keras ""horn"" and Latin cornu ""horn"", it has been suggested that Cerinthus may be the same as the friend, Cornutus, to whom Tibullus addresses a birthday poem (Tibullus 2.2), as well as a longer poem (2.3). The close verbal echoes between 2.2 and the some of the poems in the Garland (see below) are also suggestive that the works are in some way connected and that Cornutus and Cerinthus are the same person. One suggestion (if the Garland dates from the time of Tibullus) is that the Garland may have been written to celebrate the anniversary of Sulpicia and Cornutus's marriage."

" Clark spent over a decade in print journalism, including a stint as Sports Assignment Editor for USA Today. While filling that role, Clark says he pushed for better media coverage of bowling, feeling that the media ""never treated bowling fairly."" As industry insiders read and responded to Clark's articles, it led to his first job in the bowling business as Chief Marketing Officer for the United States Bowling Congress (USBC) in 2005. In April 2008, he was hired as Deputy Commissioner of the PBA, working under then-Commissioner and CEO Fred Schreyer. Clark's time as Deputy Commissioner coincided with the collapse of the U.S. financial industry in 2008 and 2009. Faced with financial issues, the PBA and ESPN jointly worked on ways to cut costs. One idea was to hold multiple tournaments in one location which could have the final rounds recorded and aired at a later date, thus saving on talent and crew travel costs. It also reduced the travel costs for PBA players, who are essentially independent contractors that take care of their own travel expenses. The result was the very first PBA World Series of Bowling, which Clark takes credit for creating, held August-September 2009 in Allen Park, Michigan. The World Series of Bowling continues through the present, and held its 14th annual event in 2023."

" Since the establishment of the standard, the policy for compiling dictionaries has been to publish character books that are based on the assumption that all JIS basic Kanji characters are listed. However, for ghost characters included in JIS Basic Kanji, it is not possible to refer to past sources. Therefore, their treatment differed depending on the dictionaries and individual characters as follows.

" In 1918, Wimble built a small ship at Hastings with help from a friend and sailed to the West Indies to seek his fortune after his family faced financial hardship. In 1922, he acquired land in the Bahamas which enabled him to begin trading with the English colonies in mainland North America. He also acquired land in North Carolina, which was formally granted to him by George Burrington's council on August 4, 1723. Wimble later moved to Boston, Massachusetts where he married Rebecca Waters, the daughter of a prominent local, on March 26, 1724. Their first son, James, was born on December 20, 1724. He owned land in the South End which he presumably operated as a distillery. While in Boston, he continued his business of moving trade goods between North Carolina and various British trade posts in the West Indies. This business enabled him to increase his land holdings in North Carolina and purchase a brigantine, which he named ""Rebecca"" after his wife. In 1932, Wimble lost his ship and all of its cargo to a hurricane after being forced by Governor Woodes Rogers of the Bahamas to use his ship to protect vessels and salt ponds in Rum Cay. Wimble was forced to sell a portion of his belongings, land, and slaves to cover the loss and began the process of trying to collect damages from Woodes Rogers' commandeering of his ship."

On October 5, 1956, he pleaded not guilty to the charges. However, on October 18, 1956, he changed his plea to guilty. After verifying that Snowden understood his guilty plea waived his right to a trial by jury and could lead to a life sentence or an execution, Judge M. Oliver Koelsch scheduled a hearing for October 23 to determine the degree of murder Snowden committed, as well as a punishment. The court ultimately determined that Snowden's crime was a first-degree murder and that there were no mitigating circumstances they could identify to justify reducing his punishment, so on October 26, Snowden was sentenced to death. His death sentence was initially scheduled to be carried out on December 7, 1956, but Snowden's lawyer filed a notice of appeal on his behalf, causing the initial execution date to be automatically delayed. In his appeal, Snowden argued that Dean's murder did not meet the criteria of a first-degree murder because he did not exhibit ""malice aforethought."" Snowden's attorney also requested a commutation of Snowden's sentence based on purported mental illness, as well as based on the argument that the crime more closely resembled second-degree murder or manslaughter, rather than first-degree murder, and that the death penalty was a disproportionately harsh punishment. In a unanimous opinion, the Idaho Supreme Court rejected Snowden's appeal. In September 1957, Judge Koelsch set Snowden's execution date for October 18, 1957."	Edward Snowden, a 19-year-old man from Ada, Idaho, was sentenced to death in 1956 after pleading guilty to the first-degree murder of a man named John Dean.
 Barbary pirates were pirates who began their operations in the early 17th century in the Mediterranean Sea. Subsequently, they experienced substantial growth in their activities, leading to an increase in their popularity.During the early 17th century, the Dutch Republic embarked on an extensive territorial expansion, solidifying its dominant position as a major maritime power. Concurrently, it established a vast presence in international trade, making significant inroads in global commerce. The Dutch strategically established colonies and trading posts across various continents, including Asia, Africa, and the Americas, facilitating the flourishing exchange of valuable commodities, ranging from spices and textiles to precious metals. As a result of these endeavors, the Dutch Republic emerged as one of the foremost trading nations of that era, commanding a pervasive influence across the seas. The Dutch Republic displayed robust activity in the Mediterranean Sea engaging in frequent trade within the region. They established significant trade ties with countries situated along the Mediterranean coast, forging commercial relationships that were characterized by regular exchanges of goods and commodities. The Dutch's active presence in the Mediterranean facilitated the flow of various valuable products, further contributing to their status as a major trading nation during this period. The Dutch, who were known for their economic prosperity and active engagement in trade, found itself as a target of Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean Sea These pirates, seeking to plunder the wealth carried by Dutch ships, engaged in acts of harassment and attacks. Consequently, in 1618, the Dutch authorities responded by declaring war on both Tunisia and Algiers.	During the 17th century, the Dutch Republic was the target of Barbary pirates, who carried out attacks on Dutch ships in the Mediterranean Sea.
 At his death, Lat Sukaabe left Cayor to a son by an Ayor wife and Baol to a son by a Baol-Baol wife. Without his leadership, conflict between the two sister kingdoms immediately resumed. The French, having learned how inconvenient it could be to have Cayor and Baol united, continually interfered to keep them apart. The constant wars between them provided both a consistent supply of slaves and a ready market for European weaponry. : 85 Lat Sukaabe ensured the dominance of the Gej matrilineage for much of the next two centuries, supplanting the Dorobe and Gelwaar.

 Emperors Leopold I and Joseph I were striving to restore their rights in imperial Italy. A major point of contention regarded Parma and Piacenza, both of which were claimed by the Emperor and the Pope simultaneously. After the Siege of Turin during the War of the Spanish Succession, Joseph I strengthened his efforts to restore imperial rights in Italy. That the Pope had sided with the Bourbons against the Habsburgs also played a role in the conflict. In 1701, he had recognized Phillip of Anjou as the King of Spain. Concessions made by the Emperor to Lutherans in Silesia had also displeased the Pope. Papal territories had already been occupied by imperial forces in the campaigns of 1706 and 1707. In the territories considered to be part of the Empire, war taxes were levied. The Pope had retaliated with ecclesiastical penalties directed at imperial commanders and officials. Rinaldo d’Este, Duke of Modena, had sided with the Emperor, and his territories had suffered at the hands of French troops. He proceeded to claim the rule of the Duchy of Ferrara and the County of Comacchio. Both of these areas belonged to the Papal States. However, the Duke presented documents that stated the territories were really part of the Empire. His account of the matter was believed in Vienna. The Emperor allowed General Claude Alexandre de Bonneval to occupy Comacchio on May 24th, 1708. The imperial troops began to fortify the city and built a tower with an inscription meant to strengthen the imperial claim. These events triggered an open conflict. Behind the decision to escalate stood among others the Empress Wilhelmine Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg, who was also the sister of the Duchess of Modena. Another force behind the move was Charles Theodore, Prince of Salm. The Emperor himself approved the course of action, although Eugene of Savoy and others had advised against it. The goal was the Pope’s recognition of Archduke Charles as King of Spain and the expansion of imperial influence in Italy. A statement was released sharply criticizing the politics of the Pope. The Pope was accused of usurping feudal rights over Parma and Piacenza, supporting France, and punishing the imperial generals with unjust ecclesiastical rulings. This statement was interpreted by the papal court as a declaration of war.	The Pope and the Duke of Modena were involved in a long-running conflict between emperors in the Roman Empire.
 The main Swedish consumer cooperative organisation, Kooperativa Förbundet (KF), was founded in 1899, with the organisation being a dominant player in the Swedish market throughout the 20th century. The main brand of KF stores was Konsum, though it was one among many, with many different chains existing within the KF organisation. Ahead of the merger into Coop Norden KF centralised their branding under the Coop name in the early 2000s, with larger Konsum stores becoming Coop Konsum, and various hypermarket brands being centralised as Coop Forum.In 2015 the Coop chain was rebranded as part of a reorganisation within the KF organisation, with stores being branded under the Coop, Stora Coop and the short-lived Lilla Coop names.	The present invention relates to a chain of hypermarket stores which is a part of the main consumer cooperative organisation,erativa Frbundet.

 The economy prior to the eighteenth century was essentially a subsistence economy, which was also very much subject to the vagaries of geopolitics, which meant that attention was focused on ways of allocating resources to activities that produced food or strengthened the means of defence. As a result, cultural activities that detracted from production, defence or religion were generally viewed with suspicion, except by mercantilists, who saw them as a way of improving the trade balance. Cultural activities were seen as deeply linked to the passions, and as an expression of vices such as jealousy, envy, pride and lust, they were seen as something to be fought. So when Jean Bodin ranked city dwellers in order of social merit in 1576, he placed artists at the bottom. Even Bernard Mandeville, for whom the organisation of selfish passions is the driving force behind economic growth, only advises indulging in the arts as a means of avoiding other, more costly extravagances.However, both of these authors were interested in the problem of determining the price of works of art. For Bodin, the value of works of art or luxury items was essentially determined by demand, which in turn was linked to trends. Anticipating Veblen, he highlighted the conspicuous consumption dimension of the artistic demand of his time: it was all about flaunting one's wealth. Mandeville, for his part, also noted that an artist's reputation and the social position of his buyers had a major influence on the value placed on his work. To these determinants, he adds rarity, but also the conformity of the work to its model. In this, he agrees with Jean Bodin and Ferdinando Galiani that the fundamental value of art lies in its ability to highlight and exalt the true nature of its model and to educate viewers about virtue through its power to represent elevated feelings.

 In total, 191 civilians were killed by the clashes and massacres by the two gangs, although the real total is unknown, due to many bodies having not been found. Ten members of Chen Mechan were killed, including the seven by Celestin. Haitian authorities arrested three people, including the leader of the 400 Mawozo-affiliated Baz 222 gang. The police also installed new checkpoints in Plaine du Cul-de-Sac following the clashes. Several weapons were seized as well. In Butte Boyer, every house was searched and then destroyed by Chen Mechan. In other neighborhoods, eighty-one houses in total were destroyed in the fighting. By June 27, 2022, there had been no trials of the three gang members arrested. The Haitian government had also not released a statement by that time. Chen Mechan members were still conducting raids in Plaine du Cul-de-Sac in late June, looking for 400 Mawozo informants. Many of the displaced fled to the Clericine public square, a majority of whom do not want to return.	In total, 191 civilians were killed by the clashes and massacres by the two gangs .

 In 1980, a foreign activist cut nets to release 250 to 300 dolphins caught in fishing on Iki Island. : 80–81 Peter Singer, a researcher in ethical philosophy, came to Japan from Australia to defend. A Japanese district court sentenced the activist to six months in prison, suspended for three years. In December 1980, a joint operation between Futo and Kawana was being conducted in Futo, when a small whale escaped by foreign activists. 。 Demand for dolphins increased as a substitute for whales around the time of the commercial whaling moratorium. The number of porpoises captured increased from 16,515 in 1986 to 40,367 in 1988. As a result, catch limits were established for each fishing method and for each dolphin species, beginning with the 1991 porpoises.

 Alongwith many classic shloka from Bhagvad Gita, the following shloka has a great significance:- Following is the English translation of the shloka:- O Arjuna! You have the right to perform your own duty! But you should not be concerned about it's outcomes. Never be motivated by the results of your actions, nor should you be attached to not performing your prescribed duties. The shloka was widely used in India. It was the introductory theme song of BR Chopra's B.R. Films. The shloka was used in S.S. Rajamouli's 2022- Telugu Movie RRR, by Ram Charan. Furthermore, the shloka was widely used at different times and by many politicians in India. Prominent Indian Independence Movement leader, Mahatma Gandhi's interpretation of the Sankhya Yoga chapter in the Bhagavad Gita revolved around selfless action, non-attachment, and the concept of duty. He believed that individuals should focus on performing their responsibilities without being attached to the results. This philosophy guided his approach to nonviolent resistance, where actions were taken with sincerity and without the desire for personal gain. The Mahatma Gandhi emphasized the importance of self-discipline and renunciation of material desires, aligning with the Gita's teachings on detachment. His legacy in Sankhya Yoga lies in his application of these principles to social and political activism, advocating for justice, equality, and freedom through peaceful means. This interpretation continues to inspire individuals globally to engage in selfless service and contribute to positive societal change.	India's Mahatma Gandhi has a significant role in the teachings of the Bhagvad Gita, which revolved around selfless action and non-engagement.
 The AN/PSQ-42 Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular combines two image intensification tubes with an uncooled thermal imager and is able to operate in an I²-only mode or a fusion mode that combines I² with a thermal image overlay. The overlay is also capable of displaying a compass and augmented reality data from a Nett Warrior device. The ENVG-B can also display wirelessly transmitted weapon sight crosshair and thermal imagery from the Family of Weapon Sights-Individual (FWS-I) thermal imager mounted on a weapon. The image-intensifying tubes also allows the user to illuminate, designate, and engage targets conventionally with weapon-mounted infrared laser pointer-illuminator devices such as the AN/PEQ-15. The entire ENVG-B assembly consists of the ENVG-B goggles themselves, Positioning Assembly (PA), Helmet Mount Assembly (HMA) and battery pack. In a fashion similar to the AN/PSQ-20 and AN/PVS-31, the ENVG-B does not receive power from a battery within the goggle housing itself (such as in the AN/PVS-14). Instead, the goggle receives power from the battery pack mounted on the rear of the soldier's helmet via a circuit that traverses the HMA and PA, with hotshoe connectors at the interface between those components. This shifts the center mass of an ENVG-B equipped helmet toward the wearer's neck, resulting in a more ergonomic balance and reducing neck strain, especially in the prone. The ENVG-G assembly can be mounted on the ACH, ECH and IHPS helmets. A special helmet cover designed to conceal the battery pack and HMA exists for the ACH and ECH. A small infrared illuminator is built into the housing for viewing handheld items like a map, weapon, or radio. A gain control knob is centrally mounted on the bridge of the goggle housing. Both the eyepieces and objective lenses are capable of affixing a protective sacrificial lens, and the objective lenses have removable protective rubber caps with lanyards.

" The term ""Karma Yoga"" is derived from two Sanskrit words: ""Karma"" and ""Yoga."" In Sanskrit, ""Karma"" means action or deed. It refers to the actions or activities performed by an individual, including their thoughts, words, and physical actions. ""Yoga"" means union or connection. It signifies the process of uniting the individual self (atman) with the universal consciousness or the Divine (Brahman). When combined, ""Karma Yoga"" can be understood as the path of selfless action, where an individual performs their duties and responsibilities without attachment to the results, aiming to attain spiritual growth and union with the Divine. It emphasizes the importance of performing actions as a service or offering to the Divine, without seeking personal gains or rewards."	Karma Yoga is a form of spiritual practice that aims to bring the individual self into union with the Divine, through the practice of selfless action.
" Andrews returned to his education in 1994. He pursued a PhD in chemistry at Stanford University under the direction of Steven Boxer, which he completed in 2001. His research focused on the effects of electric fields on molecular vibrations, called the vibrational Stark effect, which he investigated with infrared spectroscopy. In the process, he developed a liquid nitrogen immersion cryostat and novel FTIR scanning methods. After earning his PhD, Andrews switched fields to systems biology. This started with post-doctoral research in Dennis Bray's laboratory at the University of Cambridge (2001-2003), where he investigated spatial aspects of cell signaling. As part of this work, he developed a spatially detailed biochemical simulator called Smoldyn, a project that has continued to be a major part of his career. Andrews followed this position with several others: more post-doctoral research in Adam Arkin's laboratory at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (2003-2007), a visiting scientist position at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (2007), a staff scientist position at the Molecular Sciences Institute (2008-2009), a staff scientist position in Roger Brent's laboratory at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (2009-2016), a physics teaching position at Seattle University (2015-2020), and his current scientist position in Herbert Sauro's laboratory at the University of Washington (2020-). Andrews's research has continued to focus on algorithm and software development for spatially detailed biochemical modeling, including particle, filament, and surface dynamics. His software, Smoldyn, is used for biophysics and cell modeling research. Andrews has also worked on non-spatial biochemical models. For example, in work with Roger Brent, he found that symmetric ""push-pull"" reaction mechanisms are able to make biochemical signaling outputs depend linearly on their inputs."

 Imambara Zadibal has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. From the period of Sultan Nazuk Shah by Mirza Douglat in 1548 AD to the reign of Maharaja Ranbir Singh in 1872 AD, this shrine was burnt down around eleven times. At the time Imambara Zadibal was constructed. However, Mirza Hyder Kashgari Douglat set this shrine on fire in 1548 AD. Daulat Chak began rebuilding it in 1551. Zafar Kupawari set Imambara Zadibal on fire for the second time in 1553. It was burned down again in 1653 during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. In 1682 AD, when Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir ruled, Imambara Zadibal was set on fire again. In 1719 AD, it was burned down for the fifth time during the Mukhtawi Khan clash. It caught fire for the sixth time in 1748 AD. Again in 1763. Imambara Zadibal caught fire again in June 1801, during Afghan rule in Kashmir, just before Ashura.In July 1830, the shrine was the site of a massacre when Jammu and Kashmir were under Sikh rule. This same day, many Shias were cruelly murdered. This happened at Ali Park in Zadibal or Margibal. Imambara Zadibal was rebuilt with the financial help sent by Nawab Hakim Mehndi Ali Khan, the prime minister of Awadh's King Nasir-ud-din Haider. This grant was sent to Haji Baqir Khan Irani, who passed on the duty of rebuilding this structure to Hatim Mir. In September 1872, the building was again set ablaze under the rule of Maharaja Ranbir Singh. He was a Dogra Ruler of J&K. This time, the king gave considerable financial aid of about Rs. 3 lakhs to renovate the Imambara and restore it to its current prosperous condition.	Imambara set Imambaraadibal on fire for the first time in 155. Imambara set Imambaraadibal on fire for the second time in 155. Imambara set Imambaraadibal on fire for the third time in 155.

 In the men's championship division finals, the 2000 champions, Penn State, would face North Carolina in their national finals debut. While all of Penn State's previous 5 games were within a goal, North Carolina would cut it much closer, requiring extra time in their previous two games, including a nine-round penalty shootout with Illinois in the semifinals. Despite playing nearly 30 extra minutes, North Carolina started early with a goal from Eric Rossitch in the 5th minute off of a header near the 6-yard box off of a free kick. A goal in the last minute by Daniel Goff while Penn State had all 11 men in North Carolina's half would see North Carolina win 2–0. This was North Carolina's first national title and the first national title by a Region II team, the only region who hadn't had a team claim a men's championship national title. In the women's championship finals, the 2012 champions, Michigan State, would face Colorado State who were looking on claiming their fourth national title. Both teams required extra time in the semifinals and Colorado State further needed penalty kicks to decide not only the semifinals, but also the quarterfinals. Following the trend for both teams, the game would remain 0-0 after 80 minutes, meaning extra time would be required. Four minutes into extra time, eventual MVP Danielle Manning of Michigan State would break the deadlock with a sudden-victory goal that gave Michigan State their second women's national title. Both of Michigan State's titles were won in extra time. In the men's open finals, Oregon would return to the open finals after their title 10 years ago in 2005 to face UC-Davis who were making their debut. Coming in, Oregon won each of their previous 5 games by at least 2 goals while UC-Davis had only given up a single goal. UC-Davis would go up 2–1 in the match, but Oregon's Henry Fassinger would score a penalty kick late into the game to tie the game at 2-2, forcing the game into extra time. Eventual MVP, Andrew Saenz of Oregon, would score a sudden-victory goal to secure Oregon's 3–2 win and their second national title.In the women's open finals, 2012 open champions, JMU, would face last year's open runners-up UCLA.

" In poem 3.13 Sulpicia calls herself ""Sulpicia daughter of Servius"" (Servi filia Sulpicia), and in poem 3.13 she addresses Messalla (presumably Tibullus's patron Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, consul in 31 BC) as propinque ""relative"". On this basis Haupt (1871) identified Sulpicia as the granddaughter of Cicero's friend, Servius Sulpicius Rufus (consul 51 BC), who died in 43 BC, whose son is said to have married Messalla's sister. If so, Sulpicia would have been Messalla's niece. Some scholars write that she was Servius Sulpicius Rufus's daughter; if so, this would make Messalla her brother-in-law. Cērinthus, from the Greek κήρινθος ""bee bread"", is thought to be a synonym. Because of the similarity of consonants (c, r, n, t), as well as the metrical equivalence of the two names, and the resemblance between Greek κέρας keras ""horn"" and Latin cornu ""horn"", it has been suggested that Cerinthus may be the same as the friend, Cornutus, to whom Tibullus addresses a birthday poem (Tibullus 2.2), as well as a longer poem (2.3). The close verbal echoes between 2.2 and the some of the poems in the Garland (see below) are also suggestive that the works are in some way connected and that Cornutus and Cerinthus are the same person. One suggestion (if the Garland dates from the time of Tibullus) is that the Garland may have been written to celebrate the anniversary of Sulpicia and Cornutus's marriage."

" In traditional Chinese medicine, several medicinal teas incorporate cash coins as ingredients. This usage of cash coins has been documented as early as the Eastern Jin dynasty, in China's first emergency medicine manual, Zhou hou fang (肘後方).Brass cash coins would first be thoroughly washed before their usage in this process and then boiled in water to produce a type of ""tea"" which was later consumed by the patient. Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine believe that the zinc present in cash coins, which had been leached into the slightly acidic liquid, are said to supposedly promote both healing and the enhancement of the immune system. Meanwhile, bronze cash coins which typically have high concentrations of lead and tin (which in traditional Chinese medicine are said to have the same ""medicinal properties"" as the element mercury), were typically boiled to produce a solution used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of the auris externa. Vietnamese cash coins, which have the highest levels of zinc of any cash coins, were ground up into a powder that was mixed into an aqueous solution or a type of ointment for the treatment of the eyes, ears, and hemorrhoids, or for more topical uses."

" Prior to the 2024 contest, Croatia has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest twenty-nine times since its first entry in 1993. The nation's best result in the contest is fourth, which it achieved on two occasions: in 1996 with the song ""Sveta ljubav"" performed by Maja Blagdan and in 1999 with the song ""Marija Magdalena"" performed by Doris Dragović. Following the introduction of semi-finals in 2004, Croatia has this far featured in eight finals. In 2023, Croatia qualified to the final (for the first time since 2017) with Let 3 and the song ""Mama ŠČ! "", finishing in 13th place. The Croatian national broadcaster, Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT), broadcasts the event within Croatia and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. Since first participating in 1993, HRT has consistently organised the national final Dora in order to select the Croatian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest, with a parenthesis between 2012 and 2018, when the broadcaster either opted out of participation or internally selected its entries. On 14 September 2023, HRT confirmed Croatia's participation in the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest and its intention to continue to use Dora to select the nation's entry."

 Weissman was born in Chicago and grew up in Boston, where he was educated at Boston Latin School. There he served as an assistant business manager of the Boston School Register, the student newspaper. Following this, he attended Harvard, where he became active in the Marxist circles and joined the Young People's Socialist League. After the expulsion of the Trotskyists from the Socialist Party in 1938, he was a founding member of the Socialist Workers Party in 1938, along with Larry Trainor and Antoinette Konikow, among others. During the Spanish Civil War, Weissman attempted to go to Spain to fight with the Loyalists but was prevented by the theft of his money while he was traveling to Algeria. In 1941, Weissman was drafted into the army. In 1943 at the USO canteen in New Jersey, he met Constance Fox Harding, a wealthy New York society leader, who was volunteering there. They were married in September, after Constance received a divorce in June from her husband, William Barclay Harding. Following their marriage, Constance joined the SWP and remained a party member and Trotskyist until her death in 1971.	Weissman was born in Chicago and grew up in Boston.

 The cave is located in the Thal-Kittelsthal karst complex, a former Zechstein reef. This region was in a threshold position at the beginning of the Zechstein period; Thuringia was covered by the Zechstein Sea, which had only a shallow water depth in this threshold region. In these shallow water areas, favored by the climatic conditions, many calcareous coral reef found a habitat. These reef-builders died off under increasingly inhospitable living conditions and were gradually covered by sediments of the higher Zechstein. The Thuringian Forest was uplifted by Saxonian fracture block tectonics; to a lesser extent this also affected areas of the foreland such as the Kittelsthal region, parts of which were later eroded again. This provided favorable conditions for karstification. Water sank over fissures and ponors in the reef complex and the dripstone caves began to form. In larger cavities, the dissolution of the limestone by carbonic acid formed stalactites, stalagmites and stalagnates of various sizes and shapes. In the cave there are also sporadic eccentrics, sideways or upward curved outgrowths of a few centimeters in length, independent of gravity.	The present invention relates to a cave located in the karst-telsthal karst complex.
 During the late 19th century, the growth of Oberschöneweide and Niederschöneweide was closely linked to the rapid expansion of Berlin's large-scale industry. The presence of railways and waterways provided favorable conditions for the establishment of industrial settlements. At the same time, however, constructing paths and roads and connecting them to the Chausseenetz of the district of Teltow became necessary. To create the first permanent link between the two banks of the Spree River, a chain ferry was established in 1885, and funded by the district. The ferry connection operated until 1891 when it was replaced by a wooden bridge in 1890/1891. This bridge also accommodated the tracks of the Oberschöneweide industrial railroad (Bullenbahn), which connected seventeen newly established factories in Oberschöneweide to the Berlin-Görlitz railroad line. The 121-meter-long bridge over the Spree was a wooden truss structure with nine openings, with three in the middle serving as ship passages. In addition to this bridge, other Spree crossings were built around the same time, such as the Kaisersteg (1898, pedestrian bridge) and the Treskowbrücke (1904), which together helped to relieve traffic in Schöneweide. However, the wooden bridge quickly deteriorated and, after only ten years, a new fixed crossing was urgently needed. The district administration opted for a steel bridge constructed of three arches of unequal length, which also had to accommodate the tracks of the industrial railroad leading to the Oberschöneweide factories. The new construction led to re-routing streetcar lines operated by the Berlin Ostbahnhof exclusively over the neighboring Treskow Bridge. The bridge plans were developed by Berlin civil engineer Karl Bernhard, who was also responsible for the superstructure. Preparatory work began in 1905, and the entire construction costs were covered by the municipality. Before the new Stubenrauch Bridge was built, there was only the Kaisersteg for pedestrians to cross the Spree and the later Treskow Bridge for vehicles, but the latter was a rather dilapidated wooden structure at the time. When the new bridge was inaugurated, it was named Stubenrauchbrücke in honor of the former Teltow district administrator, Ernst von Stubenrauch.	A new bridge has been inaugurated in Berlin following the creation of a bridge over the River Spree, which was built in the 1930s.
" In 1577, William Camden (1551–1623) began his great work Britannia, a topographical and historical survey of all of Great Britain and Ireland. His stated intention was to ""restore antiquity to Britaine, and Britain to his antiquity"". The first edition, written in Latin, was published in 1586. It proved very popular, and ran through five further Latin editions, of 1587, 1590, 1594, 1600 and 1607, each greatly enlarged from its predecessor in both textual content and illustrations. The 1607 edition included for the first time a full set of English county maps, based on the surveys of Christopher Saxton and John Norden, and engraved by William Kip and William Hole (who also engraved the fine frontispiece). The first English-language edition, translated by Philemon Holland, appeared in 1610, again with some additional content supplied by Camden. Britannia is a county-by-county description of Great Britain and Ireland. It is a work of chorography: a study that relates landscape, geography, antiquarianism, and history. Rather than write a history, Camden wanted to describe in detail the Great Britain of his time, and to show how the traces of the past could be discerned in the existing landscape. By this method, he produced the first coherent picture of Roman Britain."	The first English-language edition of Britain's first county maps has appeared in the early 16th Century.
 Shortly after its establishment, the bubble economy collapsed, and it was affected by the Heisei recession and the lost decade that came after. After that, in addition to the recession, there were circumstances unique to the industry, such as construction work to support digital terrestrial broadcasting and a shift away from television. Many stations are small. Also, in the analog era, there were few relay stations Many broadcasting stations do not include all households in broadcast area. For this reason, in areas where direct reception is impossible, install a high-gain antenna in a higher position, rebroadcast cable TV, or even receive it at existing stations in surrounding prefectures. Even in the new Heisei station, there are special circumstances due to geographical relationships. Furthermore, for the above reasons, the scale of the company itself is small, and it tends to have weaker program production and sales capabilities than the TV and radio stations that have opened earlier. In addition, the stations that opened in the latter half of the 1990s were affected by the Heisei recession and were established in a smaller and more compact manner. Low number of employees Headquarters building is small or simple There are few branch offices and branch office networksand other features. As for ITV, for a while the master was placed at an affiliated station outside the prefecture. In contrast to the Nippon TV series (NNN/NNS) and TBS series (JNN), which have many starting stations, and the Fuji TV series (FNN/FNS), which expanded its network with the issuance of a large number of UHF station licenses, the TV Asahi series (ANN) network Expansion was delayed. For this reason, Heisei new stations have the most ANN member stations (out of 24 stations, 11 stations are ANN member stations). Of the 24 Fullnet stations, half joined the Heisei period. In addition, in contrast to the long-established stations led by local newspaper companies, most of the Heisei new stations' major shareholders have key stations and major affiliated stations in the top three. In addition, there are few other affiliated programs on the net, and the proportion of in-house produced programs is also small. Although the number is small, there are newspaper companies that are closely related to the Heisei Shinkyoku (Hokkoku Shimbun, Nagasaki Shimbun, Okinawa Times, etc.). Most of the Heisei new stations have not listed.	Stations that opened in the latter half of the 1990s were affected by the Heisei recession and were established in a smaller and more compact manner.

" Some time in the late 1990s or early 2000s, Johnny Science chose to go ""stealth"" - that is, to pull away from FTM activism and blend in with the cisgender gay male community. His friends regularly told him of the goings-on in the trans community, and he expressed sadness over feeling like he could not both participate and be accepted as a man by wider society. Science found a new home in gay kink communities, becoming both a member of the Gay Male S&M Activists and the Metro NY Chapter president of the National Leather Association. In the mid-1990s, Science founded The Jovian Gentlemen, a social club for older men and younger men who wanted to date each other. Many events hosted by The Jovian Gentlemen were kinky play parties. Science preserved hundreds of documents, videos, sound files, and other ephemera pertaining to his and other peoples' LGBT activism in both print and digital form in his home.Johnny Science was in ill health for the last ten years of his life. He died of heart failure in 2007 and was given an extensive obituary in issue #114 of Transgender Tapestry. The ephemera he preserved were donated to New York University after he died. In 2019, some ephemera collected by Johnny Science was displayed at NYU's Bobst Library in an exhibition entitled ""Violet Holdings: LGBTQ+ Highlights from the NYU Special Collections."""	Johnny Science, who has died at the age of 95, was a former member of the New York City Transgender Movement (FTM).
 William Bentall, a farmer who lived in Goldhanger, invented some time between 1760 and 1790 the Goldhanger plough (also known as the Essex plough), which was put on the market in 1797. In 1805, William Bentall formed a company to manufacture agricultural equipment sited on the south bank of the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation. In 1814, William's son Edward Hammond Bentall was born. Edward joined the firm at 22 in 1836, and by 1839 he had incorporated it as E.H. Bentall & Co., and in 1841 patented an improved version of his father's Goldhanger Plow. In 1851, Edward's 1843 patented design for the Broad Share Cultivator won the company the gold medal at the Great Exhibition, with a further three first prizes at the Royal Agricultural Society Show in 1859. Other patented inventions by Edward included the improved oil cake mill and the prize root pulper, which both won first prize at the Royal Society meet at Chester in 1858. With these successes Bentall's reputation grew and orders were coming in from all over the world. During the mid-1800s Bentall's started building housing for their staff. By 1889 Edward's son, Edmund Ernest Bentall had started to run the business.

 The Pan-ArcticVision is quite unique in the way that it is one of few attempts to not just the euro-arctic region, the Barents region, the Nordics, the American arctic or the international inuit community, but to in fact include the whole circumpolar North. The first edition of the Pan-ArcticVision was arranged in Vadsø, Northern Norway, a town of ca 6000 people located on the brink of the European mainland. The event was hosted by the local festival Varangerfestivalen. The project was initiated, financed and run by Nordting - the Northern Assembly, and led by artistic director and entrepreneur Amund Sjølie Sveen. == References ==	First edition of the Pan-ArcticVision was arranged in Vadsø, Northern Norway, a town of ca 6000 people located on the brink of the European mainland .

" While awaiting trial, Snowden was housed in the Ada County jail. On September 28, 1956, Snowden asked for and received a court-appointed attorney. On October 5, 1956, he pleaded not guilty to the charges. However, on October 18, 1956, he changed his plea to guilty. After verifying that Snowden understood his guilty plea waived his right to a trial by jury and could lead to a life sentence or an execution, Judge M. Oliver Koelsch scheduled a hearing for October 23 to determine the degree of murder Snowden committed, as well as a punishment. The court ultimately determined that Snowden's crime was a first-degree murder and that there were no mitigating circumstances they could identify to justify reducing his punishment, so on October 26, Snowden was sentenced to death. His death sentence was initially scheduled to be carried out on December 7, 1956, but Snowden's lawyer filed a notice of appeal on his behalf, causing the initial execution date to be automatically delayed. In his appeal, Snowden argued that Dean's murder did not meet the criteria of a first-degree murder because he did not exhibit ""malice aforethought."" Snowden's attorney also requested a commutation of Snowden's sentence based on purported mental illness, as well as based on the argument that the crime more closely resembled second-degree murder or manslaughter, rather than first-degree murder, and that the death penalty was a disproportionately harsh punishment. In a unanimous opinion, the Idaho Supreme Court rejected Snowden's appeal. In September 1957, Judge Koelsch set Snowden's execution date for October 18, 1957."

" The term ""Karma Yoga"" is derived from two Sanskrit words: ""Karma"" and ""Yoga."" In Sanskrit, ""Karma"" means action or deed. It refers to the actions or activities performed by an individual, including their thoughts, words, and physical actions. ""Yoga"" means union or connection. It signifies the process of uniting the individual self (atman) with the universal consciousness or the Divine (Brahman). When combined, ""Karma Yoga"" can be understood as the path of selfless action, where an individual performs their duties and responsibilities without attachment to the results, aiming to attain spiritual growth and union with the Divine. It emphasizes the importance of performing actions as a service or offering to the Divine, without seeking personal gains or rewards."

 In December of that year, They crossed the Heilong River and were stationed in the Russian Free City Srabske area. With the help of 500,000 Koreans and the Russian Red Army, they received weapons replenishment and sometimes participated in joint operations. Meanwhile, in February 1921, a military agreement was signed between the buffer government in Chita and the anti-Japanese independence army through the good offices of Ohamuk, a graduate of the Russian Military Academy who participated in the Russian Revolution. According to this military agreement, the independence army received weapons from them, established the Goryeo Revolutionary Military Academy (高麗革命軍官學校) to train the independence army, and participated in the subjugation of the Baekgye Army. Knowing this, Japan launched a robust diplomatic offensive against the Russian government and demanded that it disarm. Meanwhile, Russia, anxious about domestic civil war after the revolution, was wary of discord with Japan and promised to disarm the Korean Independence Army. Accordingly, on June 22, 1921, the Russian authorities issued an order to the Korean independence forces stationed in Heilongjiang Jayu City to disarm and, at the same time, attack and defeat the resisting independence forces, causing the Jayu City Incident. At this time, the Independence Army units suffered many casualties and suffered untold hardships, causing the Korean Independence Corps to disintegrate.

 North of Mbuamaji's old town (Currently called Gezaulole), on the seashore, is where the site is situated. A bulldozer has already damaged a portion of the site as of the early 2010s. There is a significant amount of both foreign and native cultural materials at the location. Dutch replicas of Chinese blue and white ceramics from the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as a Chinese blue and white potsherd, are examples of imported items. Other items include glass, red and white beads, Persian pottery, and red pottery from India that has black stripes painted on it. While some of the native pottery was painted in red or graphite, other pieces featured carved embellishments. The decorated ceramics are from the 12th–13th and 15th–16th centuries, respectively. A local potsherd was discovered to feature ornamental designs similar to those from Shungubweni and Pemba Mnazi. The abundance of both indigenous and imported cultural items sets the Mbuamaji site apart from all others north of Pemba Mnazi. Therefore, Mbuamaji ought to have been a very prosperous town. There is a rather modern mosque near the site with inscriptions from AH 1017 (1608 AD). Archaeologist Chittick's early research at the location reveals that the inscriptions were likely brought from another mosque because of the mosque's 19th-century Swahili architectural style. The inscriptions may be from an earlier mosque that once stood on the same spot, according to the updated dates for the location.	There is a large amount of native and imported pottery at the site. The pottery is decorated with ornamental designs. The pots are from the 12th and 13th centuries.

Her works focus on the unity and harmonious relationship between science and aesthetics, as well as between vernacular and modern. In the 1970s, she undertook the restoration of building structures and gardens of the Tang dynasty. Her ideas on utilising technological and scientific advancements were realised in her conservation and heritage projects, most notably the Shaanxi History Museum. The project is described as a modern architectural project by which traditional architectural elements are used as ingredients of innovation. Beyond revitalising the ancient city and its history, Zhang’s designs present architecture features of the past in the modern context. This approach, often referred as the “Neo-Tang Style”, gained popularity through her works.	An architectural project by which traditional architectural elements are used as ingredients of innovation.

 The site was split in two by the modern road. The buildings were placed around a large central peristyle (courtyard) garden. The residential part (pars urbana) of the villa with a grand facade overlooking the sea is on the eastern side. On the western side of the peristyle (and the modern road) is a richly decorated large private double bath complex. The monumental baths are as big as many ancient public baths, but their richness and magnificence of decoration are more consistent with private baths in this location. Their external appearance would also have been impressive as the roofs were vaulted and domed. The two independent bath suites is a feature of other 4th century villas and may have been influenced by Christianity, which banned mixed bathing and promoted modesty among the newly converted. Other possible parts such as the pars rustica (for servants and other workers) and the pars fructaria (for the processing of products) typical of a Roman villa have not yet been found.

 One of the former shaft buildings had been converted into a casino and ballroom; it was demolished in the 1980s due to its dilapidated state. After the closure of the coalfields, the stables opposite the old shaft were bought by a private owner before being destroyed by fire. The ruins remained until they were demolished on May 31, 2006. At the beginning of the 21st century, no trace of the installations remained (apart from the ruins of a small outbuilding) and the shaft was located under a pavilion at the foot of a hill. In September 2012, a commemorative monument to early mining was built near the old shaft. It is made up of two minecarts and a wood framing.

" People have willingly arranged to be buried alive, reportedly demonstrating their disputed ability to survive such an event for many centuries. The fear of being buried alive peaked during the cholera epidemics of the 19th century, but accounts of unintentional live burial have been recorded even earlier. Reports of doctors and accounts in literature heightened these fears. The subject is detailed in ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" and ""The Cask of Amontillado"", Edgar Allan Poe wrote ""The Premature Burial"", which was published in 1844. It contained accounts of supposedly genuine cases of premature burial and detailing the narrator's (perceived) interment while still alive. In 1822, German Dr. Adolf Gutsmuth was buried alive several times to demonstrate a safety coffin of his design, staying underground for several hours and eating a meal of soup, bratwurst, marzipan, sauerkraut, spätzle, beer, and for dessert, prinzregententorte, delivered to him through the coffin's feeding tube. In 1840, Sadhu Haridas, an Indian yogi, is said to have been buried for ten months. The yogi said that his only fear during his ""wonderful sleep"" was being eaten by underground worms. However, according to current medical science, a human can't survive for ten months without food, water, and air. According to other sources the entire burial was 40 days long. The Indian government has since made voluntary premature burial illegal because of the unintended deaths of individuals attempting to recreate this feat. In 1898, Russian Count Michel de Karnice-Karnicki invented a safety coffin called ""Le Karnice"". A long tube measuring 8.89 cm (3.5 in) in diameter was connected with an aperture in the coffin, with the other end emerging above ground (rather like the periscope of a submarine). Italian Faroppo Lorenzo consented to be buried in ""Le Karnice"". On 17 December 1898, he was buried and emerged on the 26th of December. Signor Lorenzo’s only comment, when dug up after this dismal underground Christmas vacation, was that it had been ""damned smelly down there""."

" The uprising was subject to intense criticism from Ukrainian left-wing nationalist figures. Mykhailo Hrushevsky, Ukrainian head of state prior to Skoropadskyi's coup d'état, allegedly described it as the ""darkest moment of the Ukrainian revolution."" The left wing of the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party also condemned the uprising as ""counter-revolutionary."" The Ukrainian populace reacted with ambivalence, by this point exhausted after a year of political turmoil, though Petliura faced criticism in non-partisan press organs. The remaining German soldiers in Kyiv, seeking to evacuate after the collapse of the German Empire, were primarily concerned with the continued operation of the Korosten railway station, which would allow them to return to Germany. Converesely, in Bolshevik circles, the uprising was met with support. Prior to the uprising's beginning, Bolsheviks Christian Rakovsky and Dmitry Manuilsky met with the Directorate's leaders, where they agreed to support the Directorate through ceasefire violations and recognition of the Ukrainian People's Republic in return for the legalisation of the Communist Party of Ukraine. These agreements were a tactical move by the Bolsheviks, as part of a broader campaign to weaken Ukrainian nationalists and strengthen the position of communist insurgent groups. Other left-wing groups from throughout the Russian Empire, including the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and anarchists, also supported the uprising."

 William Bentall, a farmer who lived in Goldhanger, invented some time between 1760 and 1790 the Goldhanger plough (also known as the Essex plough), which was put on the market in 1797. In 1805, William Bentall formed a company to manufacture agricultural equipment sited on the south bank of the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation. In 1814, William's son Edward Hammond Bentall was born. Edward joined the firm at 22 in 1836, and by 1839 he had incorporated it as E.H. Bentall & Co., and in 1841 patented an improved version of his father's Goldhanger Plow. In 1851, Edward's 1843 patented design for the Broad Share Cultivator won the company the gold medal at the Great Exhibition, with a further three first prizes at the Royal Agricultural Society Show in 1859. Other patented inventions by Edward included the improved oil cake mill and the prize root pulper, which both won first prize at the Royal Society meet at Chester in 1858. With these successes Bentall's reputation grew and orders were coming in from all over the world. During the mid-1800s Bentall's started building housing for their staff.

 This dish lends itself to many variations and is sometimes confused with Syracuse sauce (because of the presence of anchovies), the original recipe of which, however, often uses short pasta and does not involve the use of breadcrumbs, but rather a generous amount of vegetables, capers and olives; these are foods that are not present in the traditional recipe of this dish, with the rare exception of olives, which are black. It should also not be confused with the first course, especially in Palermo, called pasta with sardines: although tradition says it was born in the Syracuse area (but by cooks of the Arab army, camped there to conquer the city), it is quite distant from the culinary customs of the Syracuse area, considering ingredients such as raisins and pine nuts (a classic combination of Palermo cuisine), as well as saffron, and the fish that dominates the dish is sardine, not anchovy. The toasted breadcrumbs in the original pasta with sardines are not present.	It is one of the most popular foods in the Italian city of Palermo, which is known as pasta with anchovies.
 The slogan of The Farmlink Project is “Fighting food insecurity is our mission - repurposing surplus produce is our solution.”. According to the website, “The Farmlink Project is acting as the “link” connecting the broken supply chains in the agricultural and access industries.”. The Washington Post reported in 2020 that The Farmlink Project “raises money to pay farmers for produce and dairy that would otherwise be wasted, then funds the transportation to send the goods to food banks in the neediest areas around the country.”. The Farmlink Project's website states that it will cover all shipping and logistics costs, organize and oversee all transportation and delivery logistics, work with all quantities, packaging, and produce of any form, and optimize and file for maximum possible value of tax benefits for farmers. In an interview with the Boston Globe, one of the original creators of the project explained that The Farmlink Project is founded and built by “more than 200 college students from about 30 colleges - including Stanford University, Cornell University, and Georgetown University - and other walks of life.”	The Farmlink Project, a group of college students from across the United States, has announced that it will use surplus produce from farmers to send to food banks.
" The undeclared war between the United Kingdom and Argentina in April 1982 posed a problem for the editorial staff of Battle. While the British response to what was viewed as an invasion of British territory produced a boom in patriotism and interest in warfare, Battle editor Terry Magee, boys' adventure group editor Barrie Tomlinson and managing editor John Sanders ultimately agreed that 'cashing in' on the conflict would be in poor taste. As it was, the fighting concluded on 14 June 1982 and IPC swiftly planned coverage. To maintain decorum over a conflict which had seen 255 British deaths, it was decided to make a documentary-style strip simply recounting the events with no overt fictional elements. Battle co-creator and frequent contributor John Wagner was eager to write the strip, recalling he was ""ready to go"" and ""was all for bashing the Argies"" at the time. Stalwart Jim Watson drew the comic."	A comic strip based on the Battle of the Somme has been published for the first time in more than 40 years. The comic's creator John Wagner has written it.
 The period before menstruation, known as the premenstrual phase, is often linked to emotional distress. Conditions related to the menstrual cycle encompass premenstrual tension syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and the exacerbation of another medical condition during the premenstrual phase. Menstruation is linked to a range of psychopathological symptoms, such as lower self-esteem, increased anxiety, dysphoria, and feelings of being persecuted. Changes in behavior, like decreased social interaction during menstruation, can lead to feelings of loneliness and potentially contribute to the development of depression. Several reviews have reported that psychopathological symptoms and mental disorders, such as psychoses, suicidal tendencies, post-traumatic stress disorder, and addictive behaviors, tend to worsen during menstruation. Variations in ovarian hormone levels are also linked to the presence of symptoms related to eating disorders. Some comprehensive studies have indicated that women might be at a higher risk of suicide during menstruation. The symptoms occurring during menstruation can have a significant impact on mental health and lead to severe consequences.

 Monika Fleischmann trained as a fashion designer in Zurich before working in radio and studying Visual Arts/Theater Pedagogy at the Berlin University of the Arts. Wolfgang Strauss began his career as a carpenter and later studied architecture at the Berlin University of the Arts. They began their artistic journey in West Berlin in the 1980s, when the boundaries between reality and virtuality were beginning to blur. Inspired by the vibrant and dynamic atmosphere of the city as a hub of subcultures and artistic impulses, they set out to explore the interfaces between art, technology and society. Their early projects spanned multiple media, including architecture, urban space, photographic novels, collages, and audiovisual installations. During their first experiments with digital media, they found that their ideas can only be realized if art and computer science work together.	Wolfgang Strauss and Monika Fleischmann are two Berlin-based artists whose work explores the intersections of art, technology and society in the digital age.
 The poem begins with Claudian recounting the career of Eutropius, an Eastern Roman politician and court eunuch, who became highly influential in the court of the empire who was highly influential in the Imperial court. Claudian claims that Eutropius spent his early years as a catamite, which was a type of prepubescent male companion in a pederastic relationship in ancient Rome. According to Claudian, Eutropius went on to become a pimp, and a lady's maid, before being freed of slavery out of disgust. Claudian then discusses his ascent to power, then describes his actions as a ruler, and portrays him as a cruel and corrupt ruler, then his campaign into Armenia, and then his rise to the position of consul. Claudian wrote that while the senate in Constantinople approved of his rise to consul, the rest of the Roman world found it to be distasteful. According to Claudian, the goddess Roma then begs the Western Emperor Honorius and his general Stilicho to prevent the same fate from occurring in the Western empire. Following this, due to their disgust at Eutropius, the god Mars and his sister Bellona incite the Greuthungi into revolt against Eutropius. After failing to bribe the rebels, Claudian describes Eutropius turning to his general Leo to end the revolt. Leo's expedition ends in a military disaster. Following this, the goddess Aurora goes to seek Stilicho, appealing to him to intervene and save the Eastern empire.	Claudian's Ode to Eutropius, one of the most famous poems in Roman history, was written in the 4th Century.
 Fruit production: Fruit production is a major driver of deforestation around the world. In tropical countries, forests are often cleared to plant fruit trees, such as bananas, pineapples, and mangoes. This deforestation is having a number of negative environmental impacts, including: Biodiversity loss: Forests are home to a wide variety of plant and animal species, many of which are found nowhere else in the world. Deforestation is threatening these species with extinction. Ecosystem disruption: Forests play a vital role in regulating the environment. They help to absorb rainwater, prevent flooding, and mitigate climate change. Deforestation can disrupt these important ecosystem services. Land degradation: When forests are cleared, the soil is often left exposed to erosion. This can lead to land degradation, which can make it difficult to grow crops.	Deforestation is one of the biggest threats to the world's forests, according to a report by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unesco).

 Dūr-Abī-ešuḫ is attested to have been occupied during the reigns of four contiguous rulers of Babylon, Abi-Eshuh, Ammi-Ditana, Ammi-Saduqa and Samsu-Ditana. This period marked the slow decline of the Old Babylonian Empire from the glory days of Hammurabi and the early rise of the First Sealand Dynasty beginning under its first ruler Ilī-ma-AN. Under ruler Samsu-iluna, predecessor of Abi-Eshuh, Babylon lost effective control over Nippur to Ilī-ma-AN and Sealand. Abi-Eshuh fortified the southern region of the Babylonian empire and dammed the Tigris river and as a result full control of Nippur had been regained by his 5th year. It is known that on or about year 11 of the reign of Ammi-Ditana, successor in Babylon to Abi-Eshuh, the major city of Nippur came under attack and was again partially abandoned. Dūr-Abī-ešuḫ was pivotal in the defense of Nippur.	The ancient city of Nippur in northern Ethiopia has been declared a treasure trove for the reigns of the Old Babylonian Empire.
 Imambara Zadibal has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. From the period of Sultan Nazuk Shah by Mirza Douglat in 1548 AD to the reign of Maharaja Ranbir Singh in 1872 AD, this shrine was burnt down around eleven times. At the time Imambara Zadibal was constructed. However, Mirza Hyder Kashgari Douglat set this shrine on fire in 1548 AD. Daulat Chak began rebuilding it in 1551. Zafar Kupawari set Imambara Zadibal on fire for the second time in 1553. It was burned down again in 1653 during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. In 1682 AD, when Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir ruled, Imambara Zadibal was set on fire again. In 1719 AD, it was burned down for the fifth time during the Mukhtawi Khan clash. It caught fire for the sixth time in 1748 AD. Again in 1763. Imambara Zadibal caught fire again in June 1801, during Afghan rule in Kashmir, just before Ashura.In July 1830, the shrine was the site of a massacre when Jammu and Kashmir were under Sikh rule. This same day, many Shias were cruelly murdered. This happened at Ali Park in Zadibal or Margibal. Imambara Zadibal was rebuilt with the financial help sent by Nawab Hakim Mehndi Ali Khan, the prime minister of Awadh's King Nasir-ud-din Haider. This grant was sent to Haji Baqir Khan Irani, who passed on the duty of rebuilding this structure to Hatim Mir. In September 1872, the building was again set ablaze under the rule of Maharaja Ranbir Singh. He was a Dogra Ruler of J&K. This time, the king gave considerable financial aid of about Rs. 3 lakhs to renovate the Imambara and restore it to its current prosperous condition.	The Imambara Zadibal, one of the oldest shrines in Indian-administered Kashmir, has been in the same place for more than 500 years.
 Hiddensee is the largest island of the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park and combines an old cultural landscape with the heaths of the originally existing dune heath. The large new land formations in the northeast (Alter and Neuer Bessin) and south (am Gellen) of Hiddensee provide habitats for numerous invertebrates, such as worms and mussels. These then serve as food for many migratory birds. Thus, the island environment is one of the most important crane resting places in Germany. The southern tip of the island as well as the New Bessin have therefore been assigned to protection zone I of the National Park Vorpommersche Boddenlandschaft and may not be entered. There are two nature reserves on the island, the NSG Dünenheide between Neuendorf and Vitte and the NSG Dornbusch and Schwedenhagener Ufer in the north. The Hiddenseer Dünenheide is the largest coastal dune heath preserved in context in the German Baltic Sea region.In 1924, wild rabbits were released at the Dornbusch to enrich the hunt, which turned out to be a serious mistake. After only a few years, the animals had proliferated extraordinarily and the damage caused by game is still considerable today. In 1962, deer were also released on the island. Wild boars regularly come to the island from Rügen. In the mid-seventies, an elk was also sighted. Wood lizards, adders and grass snakes are also found on the island. The Naturschutzgesellschaft Hiddensee und Boddenlandschaft maintains a permanent exhibition on fauna and flora in Vitte in the national park house. From 1936 until around 2018, the Hiddensee ornithological station worked on the island, since then there is no longer an observation station here.

" In traditional Chinese medicine, several medicinal teas incorporate cash coins as ingredients. This usage of cash coins has been documented as early as the Eastern Jin dynasty, in China's first emergency medicine manual, Zhou hou fang (肘後方).Brass cash coins would first be thoroughly washed before their usage in this process and then boiled in water to produce a type of ""tea"" which was later consumed by the patient. Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine believe that the zinc present in cash coins, which had been leached into the slightly acidic liquid, are said to supposedly promote both healing and the enhancement of the immune system. Meanwhile, bronze cash coins which typically have high concentrations of lead and tin (which in traditional Chinese medicine are said to have the same ""medicinal properties"" as the element mercury), were typically boiled to produce a solution used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of the auris externa. Vietnamese cash coins, which have the highest levels of zinc of any cash coins, were ground up into a powder that was mixed into an aqueous solution or a type of ointment for the treatment of the eyes, ears, and hemorrhoids, or for more topical uses."

 The minority stress model takes into account significant stressors that distinctly affect the mental health of those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or another non-conforming gender identity. Some risk factors that contribute to declining mental health are heteronormativity, discrimination, harassment, rejection (e.g., family rejection and social exclusion), stigma, prejudice, denial of civil and human rights, lack of access to mental health resources, lack of access to gender-affirming spaces (e.g., gender-appropriate facilities), and internalized homophobia. The structural circumstance where a non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming individual is embedded in significantly affects the potential sources of risk. The compounding of these everyday stressors increase poor mental health outcomes among individuals in the LGBT community. Evidence shows that there is a direct association between LGBT individuals' development of severe mental illnesses and the exposure to discrimination.In addition, there are a lack of access to mental health resources specific to LGBT individuals and a lack of awareness about mental health conditions within the LGBT community that restricts patients from seeking help.

" Andrews returned to his education in 1994. He pursued a PhD in chemistry at Stanford University under the direction of Steven Boxer, which he completed in 2001. His research focused on the effects of electric fields on molecular vibrations, called the vibrational Stark effect, which he investigated with infrared spectroscopy. In the process, he developed a liquid nitrogen immersion cryostat and novel FTIR scanning methods. After earning his PhD, Andrews switched fields to systems biology. This started with post-doctoral research in Dennis Bray's laboratory at the University of Cambridge (2001-2003), where he investigated spatial aspects of cell signaling. As part of this work, he developed a spatially detailed biochemical simulator called Smoldyn, a project that has continued to be a major part of his career. Andrews followed this position with several others: more post-doctoral research in Adam Arkin's laboratory at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (2003-2007), a visiting scientist position at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (2007), a staff scientist position at the Molecular Sciences Institute (2008-2009), a staff scientist position in Roger Brent's laboratory at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (2009-2016), a physics teaching position at Seattle University (2015-2020), and his current scientist position in Herbert Sauro's laboratory at the University of Washington (2020-). Andrews's research has continued to focus on algorithm and software development for spatially detailed biochemical modeling, including particle, filament, and surface dynamics. His software, Smoldyn, is used for biophysics and cell modeling research. Andrews has also worked on non-spatial biochemical models. For example, in work with Roger Brent, he found that symmetric ""push-pull"" reaction mechanisms are able to make biochemical signaling outputs depend linearly on their inputs."	Andrews began his scientific career as a post-graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he studied the effects of electric fields on molecular vibrations.
 The period before menstruation, known as the premenstrual phase, is often linked to emotional distress. Conditions related to the menstrual cycle encompass premenstrual tension syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and the exacerbation of another medical condition during the premenstrual phase. Menstruation is linked to a range of psychopathological symptoms, such as lower self-esteem, increased anxiety, dysphoria, and feelings of being persecuted. Changes in behavior, like decreased social interaction during menstruation, can lead to feelings of loneliness and potentially contribute to the development of depression. Several reviews have reported that psychopathological symptoms and mental disorders, such as psychoses, suicidal tendencies, post-traumatic stress disorder, and addictive behaviors, tend to worsen during menstruation. Variations in ovarian hormone levels are also linked to the presence of symptoms related to eating disorders. Some comprehensive studies have indicated that women might be at a higher risk of suicide during menstruation. The symptoms occurring during menstruation can have a significant impact on mental health and lead to severe consequences.	The present invention relates to the treatment of symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle and more particularly to the treatment of symptoms associated with the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle.
 Belarusian Hajun was created in early January 2022 as a monitoring initiative to track movements of Russian military equipment and troops on the territory of Belarus. The project had the task of monitoring the amount of equipment transported into the country and withdrawn, and where a new Russian military base could potentially emerge. The project was created so that Belarusians would understand what was happening on the territory of Belarus. On February 20, 2022, the Telegram channel of Hajun was created, in which the team began publishing information about detected Russian troops and their movements. For the first two months of the war, the team had to work 24/7. In February and March, an average of 1500 people a day wrote to the project. At the peak, this figure reached up to 2000 people. In March 2022, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus recognized the project's Telegram channel as an extremist formation. In April 2022, more than 360 thousand people subscribed to the channel. At that time, 90% were subscribers from Ukraine, and the rest were Belarusians. As of February 25, 2023, more than half a million people were subscribed to the project's Telegram channel.

 In 1995, a portion of the archipelago was declared a marine park under the Tanzania Marine parks Authority, a department of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism. The Islands are known as a major breeding ground for whale sharks. At a depth of less than 20 meters below mean tide levels is where more than half of the Mafia Island Marine Park, which has an area of 822 km2, is situated. The bulk of the marine park consists of other reef portions in south Bwejuu Island and the wide area south of the bay surrounded by Mafia, Jibondo, and Juani Islands. A magnificent mosaic of tropical marine ecosystems, including mangrove swamps, coral reefs, and seagrass meadows, may be found in the area. It also supports a huge diversity of fish and other top marine species. Two endangered kinds of sea turtles can find a home in the park. == References ==	The Mafia Island archipelago is a group of islands off the coast of Tanzania that make up one of the world's largest marine parks, with an area of more than 822 km2.
 Tipu's father was a government official and mother was a housewife, while his elder brother played the Hawaiian guitar and his elder sister was a singer of Rabindra and Nazrul songs. His youngest sister was a classical dancer, and his second brother was a national gymnast and goalkeeper for the Victoria Sporting Club. Inspired by his second brother, Tipu trained as a goalkeeper in football and in gymnastics. In 1976, Tipu began playing the tabla and formed a musical group with his cousins and neighbors, participating in the reality show 'Notunkuri' on Bangladesh Television. He made his debut as a drummer on a program on Bangladesh Television with the Bishforon Musical group, and later joined the Pony Musical Group. After playing with the band 'Stars', he formed his own band called 'Scorcher', which lasted for two years. After completing his matriculation examination from Bangladesh Bank High School in 1985, he was admitted to Notre Dame College and played drums for two years in Azam Khan (singer)'s Uchcharan. Tipu has been with Warfaze after a year since its formation in 1986, providing drums play, percussion play, and rhythm composition for all eight of the band's music albums. He is also known for playing in the band “Pentagon” and “Winning” which garnered huge success. He also served as the General Secretary of Bangladesh Musical Bands' Association (BAMBA).

 The slogan of The Farmlink Project is “Fighting food insecurity is our mission - repurposing surplus produce is our solution.”. According to the website, “The Farmlink Project is acting as the “link” connecting the broken supply chains in the agricultural and access industries.”. The Washington Post reported in 2020 that The Farmlink Project “raises money to pay farmers for produce and dairy that would otherwise be wasted, then funds the transportation to send the goods to food banks in the neediest areas around the country.”. The Farmlink Project's website states that it will cover all shipping and logistics costs, organize and oversee all transportation and delivery logistics, work with all quantities, packaging, and produce of any form, and optimize and file for maximum possible value of tax benefits for farmers. In an interview with the Boston Globe, one of the original creators of the project explained that The Farmlink Project is founded and built by “more than 200 college students from about 30 colleges - including Stanford University, Cornell University, and Georgetown University - and other walks of life.”	The Farmlink Project is founded and built by “more than 200 college students from about 30 colleges - including Stanford University, Cornell University, and Georgetown University - and other walks of life .

 In July 2022, the conflict in Blue Nile State flared up in the Wad el-Mahi locality due to a land dispute that erupted between the Hausa on one side, and Berta and Funj on the other. The violence in July was partially triggered by these land conflicts and aggravated by political rivalries. This resurgence of violence follows an earlier outbreak in mid-July, where intercommunal clashes claimed numerous lives and forced thousands to flee to safer areas. The conflict's humanitarian impact has been severe, with approximately 235,000 individuals displaced and seeking refuge in makeshift shelters, including schools and nearby camps. The closure of markets due to the ongoing violence has left local residents struggling to meet their basic needs, while government offices remain shuttered.The clashes have led to protests across Sudan, particularly among the Hausa community, who are demanding justice for the victims. These protests have also shed light on issues of racism and marginalisation, as the Hausa community in Sudan, part of the Hausa ethnic group from West Africa, have been perceived as outsiders in Sudan. == References ==	In July 2022, the conflict in Blue Nile State flared up in the Wad el-Mahi locality due to a land dispute that erupted between the Hausa on one side, and Berta and Funj on the other .

 The Pan-ArcticVision is quite unique in the way that it is one of few attempts to not just the euro-arctic region, the Barents region, the Nordics, the American arctic or the international inuit community, but to in fact include the whole circumpolar North. The first edition of the Pan-ArcticVision was arranged in Vadsø, Northern Norway, a town of ca 6000 people located on the brink of the European mainland. The event was hosted by the local festival Varangerfestivalen. The project was initiated, financed and run by Nordting - the Northern Assembly, and led by artistic director and entrepreneur Amund Sjølie Sveen. == References ==	The first edition of the Pan-ArcticVision was arranged in Vadsø, Northern Norway, a town of ca 6000 people located on the brink of the European mainland.

" El Velorio depicts a traditional 19th-century baquiné or velorio del angelito (""wake of a little angel""), a specific type of wake with origins in Afro-Puerto Rican culture that was celebrated by jibaros and other countrymen as funerary celebrations for the death of a child. This practice originates in the syncretic Catholic and folk belief that the death of an innocent baptized child results in their automatic ascension and entrance into Heaven and that the occasion is therefore a cause not only for remembrance but for celebration. The baquiné in this portrait depicts the deceased child as a focal point dressed in white and adorned with flowers, lying on a table at the center of a traditional countryside house. The iconography of the child, reminiscent of a Christ Child, symbolizes his purity and innocence but also presents a lighter theme that separates the painting into two visual contrasts: one lighter in colors that depicts scenes of joy and celebration with food and music, and another with darker colors and shadows that depicts not only the sorrow of the child's parents but also a chaotic scene of a priest trying to perform wake rites while dogs are running around. This exemplifies the everyday clash between life and death, and between celebration and suffering, common in the life of poor countrymen in 19th-century Puerto Rico. The scene is intentionally portrayed as a judgmental satire, with Francisco Oller himself describing the scene as “an orgy of brutish appetites under the guise of gross superstition."""	Photographer Francisco Oller has unveiled a new portrait of the deceased child in Puerto Rico, which appears to have been published in the New York Times.
 The poem begins with Claudian recounting the career of Eutropius, an Eastern Roman politician and court eunuch, who became highly influential in the court of the empire who was highly influential in the Imperial court. Claudian claims that Eutropius spent his early years as a catamite, which was a type of prepubescent male companion in a pederastic relationship in ancient Rome. According to Claudian, Eutropius went on to become a pimp, and a lady's maid, before being freed of slavery out of disgust. Claudian then discusses his ascent to power, then describes his actions as a ruler, and portrays him as a cruel and corrupt ruler, then his campaign into Armenia, and then his rise to the position of consul. Claudian wrote that while the senate in Constantinople approved of his rise to consul, the rest of the Roman world found it to be distasteful. According to Claudian, the goddess Roma then begs the Western Emperor Honorius and his general Stilicho to prevent the same fate from occurring in the Western empire. Following this, due to their disgust at Eutropius, the god Mars and his sister Bellona incite the Greuthungi into revolt against Eutropius. After failing to bribe the rebels, Claudian describes Eutropius turning to his general Leo to end the revolt. Leo's expedition ends in a military disaster. Following this, the goddess Aurora goes to seek Stilicho, appealing to him to intervene and save the Eastern empire.	The author of a poem about the Eastern Empire, Claudian, has been published in the New York Times. The poem is based on the story of one of the most influential Roman politicians.
 William Bentall, a farmer who lived in Goldhanger, invented some time between 1760 and 1790 the Goldhanger plough (also known as the Essex plough), which was put on the market in 1797. In 1805, William Bentall formed a company to manufacture agricultural equipment sited on the south bank of the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation. In 1814, William's son Edward Hammond Bentall was born. Edward joined the firm at 22 in 1836, and by 1839 he had incorporated it as E.H. Bentall & Co., and in 1841 patented an improved version of his father's Goldhanger Plow. In 1851, Edward's 1843 patented design for the Broad Share Cultivator won the company the gold medal at the Great Exhibition, with a further three first prizes at the Royal Agricultural Society Show in 1859. Other patented inventions by Edward included the improved oil cake mill and the prize root pulper, which both won first prize at the Royal Society meet at Chester in 1858. With these successes Bentall's reputation grew and orders were coming in from all over the world. During the mid-1800s Bentall's started building housing for their staff. By 1889 Edward's son, Edmund Ernest Bentall had started to run the business.	William Bentall invented the Goldhanger plough between 1760 and 1790.

" Clark spent over a decade in print journalism, including a stint as Sports Assignment Editor for USA Today. While filling that role, Clark says he pushed for better media coverage of bowling, feeling that the media ""never treated bowling fairly."" As industry insiders read and responded to Clark's articles, it led to his first job in the bowling business as Chief Marketing Officer for the United States Bowling Congress (USBC) in 2005. In April 2008, he was hired as Deputy Commissioner of the PBA, working under then-Commissioner and CEO Fred Schreyer. Clark's time as Deputy Commissioner coincided with the collapse of the U.S. financial industry in 2008 and 2009. Faced with financial issues, the PBA and ESPN jointly worked on ways to cut costs. One idea was to hold multiple tournaments in one location which could have the final rounds recorded and aired at a later date, thus saving on talent and crew travel costs. It also reduced the travel costs for PBA players, who are essentially independent contractors that take care of their own travel expenses. The result was the very first PBA World Series of Bowling, which Clark takes credit for creating, held August-September 2009 in Allen Park, Michigan. The World Series of Bowling continues through the present, and held its 14th annual event in 2023."

 In 1954, musician Ike Turner relocated his band the Kings of Rhythm from Clarksdale, Mississippi to St. Louis, Missouri. Turner performed around the greater St. Louis area and built a strong following. In 1957, Ann Bullock joined Turner's band as a vocalist and was called Little Ann. She was later given the stage name Tina Turner and they released their first song as Ike & Tina Turner in 1960. When the single became a hit, they began performing as the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. They embarked on a grueling series of one-nighters throughout the United States on the Chitlin' Circuit. They relocated to Los Angeles, California in 1962. In 1966, the Turners visited England for the first time to join the Rolling Stones on their British Tour. In 1969, they began headlining in Las Vegas, Nevada. They gained further exposure by performing at music festivals and joining the Rolling Stones for select dates on their American Tour. The revue continued to expand its audience by performing in Africa, Asia, and throughout Europe until they disbanded in 1976.	The Rolling Stones' Ike & Tina Turner Revue, which became the world's largest revue, has died at the age of 81.

 After gaining independence from the Netherlands, Indonesia claimed all Dutch colonial territories of the Malay Archipelago, including West Papua (formerly Dutch New Guinea). Following a controversial referendum known as the Act of Free Choice, the Papua conflict began as separatists from the Free Papua Movement (OPM) and West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) have conducted a low-intensity guerrilla war against the Indonesian forces, while Indonesia has been accused of conducting a genocidal camphaign against the local indigenous tribes. On 8 September 2021, members of the TPNPB burnt machinery used for the construction of the Trans-Papua Highway. 5 days later, riots broke out in Kiwirok when members of the TPNPB attacked public buildings, including a school and a medical centre, injuring nine people, one of whom later died. This incident was quite unusual for Kiwirok as TPNPB attacks have usually focused on other areas such as Oksibil. As a result, Indonesia has strengthened their military presence in Kiwirok, further intensifying the conflict. This included carrying out several raids during the months of September and October, in which Indonesian security forces took villagers' belongings, and in extreme cases, killed their livestock and even removed roofing from their homes.

 In 1950 Washington H. Soul Pattinson and Co. Ltd. bought the pharmacy business known as Edmond Samuels Pty. Ltd. Samuels retired to a house he built, in the then mostly rural suburb of Castle Hill, with his companion Joseph Smith. At the same time Patrick White, and his partner Manoly Lascaris, lived on acreage in the same area. In his death notice in 1973, Samuels was listed in the Sydney Morning Herald as formerly residing in Potts Point. He was survived by his nephew Gordon Samuels. Gordon Jacob Samuels served as the 36th Governor of New South Wales having been a Judge of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, Chancellor of the University of New South Wales and Chairman of the Law Reform Commission of New South Wales. His wife was the actor Dr Jacqueline Samuels (who was known by the stage name of Jacqueline Knott) continuing the Samuels family tradition of involvement in the theatre. == References ==	"Edmond Samuels, a former governor of New South Wales, has died at the age of 81.

 He attended the Ohio State University, where he majored in journalism. In 1956 as a member of the senior men’s Sphinx honorary society, he helped lead an effort for Ohio State alumnus Jesse Owens to be initiated into Sphinx. Bailey also interviewed Owens and wrote about him for the Ohio State University Lantern. Bailey was editor of the Ohio State University Lantern his senior year and, on April 30, 1956, wrote a front-page editorial headlined, “Yes, we are Guilty,” which bluntly called for college football players to be paid. “Pay the players,” he wrote. “Only the blind cling to the myth that it is still…amateurism... Cast aside the mask of hypocrisy.”	A series of editorials for the senior men&#39;s coinciding society which call for college football players to be paid.
" Clark spent over a decade in print journalism, including a stint as Sports Assignment Editor for USA Today. While filling that role, Clark says he pushed for better media coverage of bowling, feeling that the media ""never treated bowling fairly."" As industry insiders read and responded to Clark's articles, it led to his first job in the bowling business as Chief Marketing Officer for the United States Bowling Congress (USBC) in 2005. In April 2008, he was hired as Deputy Commissioner of the PBA, working under then-Commissioner and CEO Fred Schreyer. Clark's time as Deputy Commissioner coincided with the collapse of the U.S. financial industry in 2008 and 2009. Faced with financial issues, the PBA and ESPN jointly worked on ways to cut costs. One idea was to hold multiple tournaments in one location which could have the final rounds recorded and aired at a later date, thus saving on talent and crew travel costs. It also reduced the travel costs for PBA players, who are essentially independent contractors that take care of their own travel expenses. The result was the very first PBA World Series of Bowling, which Clark takes credit for creating, held August-September 2009 in Allen Park, Michigan. The World Series of Bowling continues through the present, and held its 14th annual event in 2023."

 The watershed of what is just called the Winter brook encompasses entirely the watershed of the Winter brook, Big brook, Black Water, and Hulpe. The source area of the Winter brook is in Korspel, a hamlet of Beringen. In the downstream direction to the west, three streams combine to contribute to the flow of the Winter brook, among them the Genemeer brook. As a result of mine subsidence, the water management in this source area was disturbed, leading to the reversal of the flow direction of the Genemeer brook, which ceased to join the Winter brook. As a result, a new connection was established from the source area of this stream to Winter brook. Between the villages of Beverlo and Beringen Mine, the brook flows westward, guided through a siphon under the Albert Canal. It now continues southwestward, passing to the north of the Paalse Lake and southeast of Tessenderlo and Deurne. Until this stage, it falls within the classification as a second-class non-navigable watercourse. Near the Paalse Lake, it becomes a watercourse of the first category due to high pollution. Further downstream, Small brook and Middle brook (Dutch:Middelbeek) run parallel to the Winter brook, and the name changes to Big brook. The valley with these parallel running streams is known as the Valley of the Three Brooks. The brook flows south of Deurne, along the area of Asdonk. When the Small brook merges into the Big brook, the name changes to Black Water. This name is given to the dark color that the water acquires due to the presence of peat soil. Beyond Molenstede, there is another name change, and the brook becomes the Hulpe, named after a significant side stream that joins it. Under the name Hulpe, it flows through the Demer Marshes before finally joining the Demer River. In the western part of the watershed, the valley is flanked by escarpments composed of iron sandstone. These escarpments are up to 30 meters higher than their surroundings.	The Winter brook (Dutch: Winter) is one of the five main streams that flow into the Demer River in the Dutch province of Flanders.
 The site was split in two by the modern road. The buildings were placed around a large central peristyle (courtyard) garden. The residential part (pars urbana) of the villa with a grand facade overlooking the sea is on the eastern side. On the western side of the peristyle (and the modern road) is a richly decorated large private double bath complex. The monumental baths are as big as many ancient public baths, but their richness and magnificence of decoration are more consistent with private baths in this location. Their external appearance would also have been impressive as the roofs were vaulted and domed. The two independent bath suites is a feature of other 4th century villas and may have been influenced by Christianity, which banned mixed bathing and promoted modesty among the newly converted. Other possible parts such as the pars rustica (for servants and other workers) and the pars fructaria (for the processing of products) typical of a Roman villa have not yet been found.	A large private double bath complex with two independent baths is described.

" After the general elections of November 2019 and the start of the 14th legislature, acting Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez (PSOE) required the abstention of the leading political parties of the nationalist left, the Catalan ERC and Basque EH Bildu, in order to form his second government during the January 2020 parliamentary session. This gesture, among other minor arrangements with EH Bildu, was a central element of criticism by the Spanish political right (mainly the People's Party and Vox). Francisco Javier García Gaztelu, nicknamed ""Txapote"", was one of the main leaders of the Basque terrorist group ETA.

 The sculpture consist of two sphinxes, with the left missing its head. Found in fragments initially, the stele was broken from side to side, along with the forelegs, which were subsequently repaired. The lower portion is decorated with a frieze of palmettes, egg, and dart, characteristic of 5th century BC style, with portions of the stele maintaining its original polychromy with red-brown pigment. Both sphinxes are faced back to back, gazing out in three-quarters perspective. The intact sphinx has its hair intact and long, pulled back on the sides, but covering her ears, and wears a crown consisting of circles and merlons, the back of the stele is roughed out with its bottom half broken off. The sphinx motif on the stele indicates it's prominence in cult objects, as prior to the stele's approximate creation, in the mid 5th century BC, the depiction was also seen in the Amathus sarcophagus, considered the most significant object in the Cesnola collection alongside the stele, famous for its preserved polychromy. == References ==	The Cesnola Stele, a 6th century BC sculpture found in Italy, is one of the oldest examples of its kind in the world.

 The economy prior to the eighteenth century was essentially a subsistence economy, which was also very much subject to the vagaries of geopolitics, which meant that attention was focused on ways of allocating resources to activities that produced food or strengthened the means of defence. As a result, cultural activities that detracted from production, defence or religion were generally viewed with suspicion, except by mercantilists, who saw them as a way of improving the trade balance. Cultural activities were seen as deeply linked to the passions, and as an expression of vices such as jealousy, envy, pride and lust, they were seen as something to be fought. So when Jean Bodin ranked city dwellers in order of social merit in 1576, he placed artists at the bottom. Even Bernard Mandeville, for whom the organisation of selfish passions is the driving force behind economic growth, only advises indulging in the arts as a means of avoiding other, more costly extravagances.However, both of these authors were interested in the problem of determining the price of works of art. For Bodin, the value of works of art or luxury items was essentially determined by demand, which in turn was linked to trends. Anticipating Veblen, he highlighted the conspicuous consumption dimension of the artistic demand of his time: it was all about flaunting one's wealth. Mandeville, for his part, also noted that an artist's reputation and the social position of his buyers had a major influence on the value placed on his work. To these determinants, he adds rarity, but also the conformity of the work to its model. In this, he agrees with Jean Bodin and Ferdinando Galiani that the fundamental value of art lies in its ability to highlight and exalt the true nature of its model and to educate viewers about virtue through its power to represent elevated feelings.	In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo looks at the value of art in the 17th century.
 In 1541, 1542 or 1543 (sources differ) Portugal established contact with Japan. Japan was then involved in a long civil-war but since Ming China had officially cut relations with Japan meant that Portuguese merchants could serve as an profitable commercial intermediary between the two nations. In 1550, the Portuguese Crown created an official trade route linking Goa, capital of its holdings in Asia, and Japan, and every year one or a number of large tradeships would sail to Japan and back, commanded by a captain-major. The Portuguese found enthusiastic commercial and diplomatical partners among Japanese lords and some, like Ōtomo Sōrin and Ōmura Sumitada converted to Christianity. Instability in Japan, or other reasons, meant that the Portuguese would occasionally be drawn into internal Japanese conflicts.	The invention is a method of establishing commercial and diplomatical relations between two nations through the intermediary of one or more large tradeships.

" Early Abiy Ahmed tenure was characterized by major reforms in human rights, including releasing several political prisoners that were detained by EPRDF regime. After the Tigrayan rebels captured Amhara Region, Abiy declared state of emergency on 2 November 2021, encouraging mass arrests individuals ""suspected of collaborating with terrorist groups"" without warrant. The US government, various human rights groups and mainstream media accused the declaration of ethnic profiling against Tigrayans. Secret vigilantes operated in Addis Ababa and submitted individuals to the government supposed supporting the TPLF and OLA rebels. Tigrayan civilians were mostly detained in Western Tigray Zone. The detentions continued after the state of emergency in the capital Addis Ababa, targeting towards to some UN staffs members who were taken from their homes. According to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, 16 staff members of Ethiopian citizen detained while six others were freed. On 20 May 2022, Brigadier General Tefera Mamo, who led the Amharan army against Tigrayan force during the Tigray War, was arrested after a comment criticizing Abiy and his affiliation in Amhara region of being ""motivated by money"". Also, by 23 May 2022, the number of arrest has been inclined; 4,500 journalists and activists were arrested in what is called ""law enforcement operations"" by the government. While Abiy state the mass arrest is justified because of stability and security reasons, critics accused the government of utterly human rights violation, including extrajudicial killings. On 5 January 2023, the Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO) experts Daniel Tesfaye, Bezuayehu Wondimu, Bereket Daniel and Nahom Husen went to a village called Alem Bank in west Addis Ababa to investigate people whose houses are demolished by the Addis Ababa municipal government. While gathering information around, unidentified police forces detained the four and forcefully disappeared for several hours until they relocated to Gelan Gudan Police Station. They were brought in Sebeta police station. Police alleged that they haven't permission letters to inform Oromia authority to carry out investigation."

 The Dunstan Mountains form the entrance to the Upper Clutha Valley. The northwest flank of the range is bound by a combination of Cluden Stream in the Lindis Valley, the Lindis River, the Clutha River (Māori: Mata-Au) and Lake Dunstan. Lake Dunstan follows the former Clutha River through the Cromwell Gorge demarcating the southwest limit of the mountains. The mountain range is bound to the east by the Manuherikia Valley and to the northeast by Dunstan Creek, which joins the Manuherikia River at Saint Bathans. The Dunstan Mountains are bisected by the 4-wheel drive Thomson Gorge Road which follows Thomsons Creek, incised into the eastern flank of the range and the Rise and Shine Creek on the western flank. Thomsons Saddle, between the two creeks, climbs to 980 m (3,220 ft) elevation. The summit landscape is generally a broad, gently sloping undulatory surface which climbs steadily from the west and falls sharply to the Manuherakia Valley floor on the east. The asymmetric nature of the Dunstan Mountains is common with most of Central Otago's basin and range mountains.	The Dunstan Mountains are the highest mountains in New Zealand's Central Otago region and rise to an average of 1,200 m (3,220 ft) above sea level.
 Incorporating elements of animation, sculpture, and sound, Nathalie Djurberg and Hans Berg construct scenarios rich in psychological tension, exploring both human and primal desires. Djurberg, since 2001, has cultivated a unique filmmaking style marked by clay animation, through which she articulates fundamental instincts such as jealousy, vengeance, avarice, submission, and lust. Since 2004, Djurberg has been working as an artistic duo with her collaborator, musician and composer Hans Berg, complementing Djurberg's animations and installations with his atmospheric sound effects and entrancing musical scores. Djurberg and Berg frequently construct mentally disconcerting environments in their films and sculptural installations. Their main characters, often depicted as girls or young women, are described by The New York Times as engaging in a spectrum of malevolent activities. These range from mild deceit and amicable torture, to curiously innocuous bestiality, and at the extreme, murder and chaos. == References ==	Nathalie Djurberg and Hans Berg construct scenarios rich in psychological tension, exploring both human and primal desires.

" The show had a mixed critical reception, with the acting being praised, but the plotting criticised. In a four-star review of the first four episodes, The Guardian's Luke Buckmaster said that it took him time to ""get accustomed to The Messenger's idiosyncratic rhythms, but soon I relished returning to this world"", noting a ""strange alchemy between setting and character"", with ""lean and uncluttered"" plotting. He praised the directors and screenwriters for ""deftly balanc[ing] comedy and drama, creating a subtle and strange quirkiness"", and for ""trust[ing] in the nature and strength of the story and the cast, allowing scenes to breathe while keeping things progressing at a good pace"", as well as the efforts by the programme's cinematographer to ensure ""retro flavour is baked into the show's aesthetic"". TV Tonight's David Knox, in a three-and-a-half star review of the first two episodes, said the series ""effectively asks you to leave your logic at the door and go with its heightened mix of drama, dark comedy and magic realism"", praising McKenna as a ""likeable lead"", and that the series impressed upon him an attempt by ABC to appeal to younger viewers, doubtful it ""will connect with core ABC viewers, and perhaps it might be best framed as premium YA content"". Mel Campbell, for ScreenHub, was more critical. In a two-and-a-half star review of the first four episodes, she opined that the series ""often seems to deliberately withhold sense-making from the audience in pursuit of its air of mystery"", and found the series flipping between what she saw as ""realist drama or magical realism"", and inconsistent motivations of the characters, as exasperating, yet nevertheless said ""the cast do their best with this flawed material""."	deftly balanc, with a director and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a director&#39;s and a

 In 1989, Lessa joined the Scuderie Detetive Le Cocq, a death squad created in 1965 to avenge the death of detective Milton Le Cocq d'Oliveira and that aimed at avenging the deaths of police officers as well. He distinguished himself in police operations in drug-trafficking dominated favelas by taking possession of seized assets from the traffickers. In 1991, he joined the Military Police and was transferred to the Civil Police in 2003, where he served until his retirement in 2010. During his service in these law enforcement agencies, he received honors at Alerj (State Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro) and a commendation at the City Council of Rio de Janeiro. According to the 2019 account from an experienced civil police officer who worked with Lessa and preferred not to be identified for safety reasons: He felt like a soldier in the midst of the Vietnam War. We conducted several operations together with a large part of the specialized police stations of the Civil Police. Bullets were flying, and their group appeared in the worst situations. Lessa was a serial killer. He had taken several shots, but he remained standing. He was a true war soldier. A killing machine. In 2009, Ronnie Lessa suffered serious injuries after a grenade detonated inside his car in the neighborhood of Bento Ribeiro. In an interview with Veja magazine, when asked about his relationship with Jair Bolsonaro, Lessa said that he was assisted by the then federal deputy to receive treatment at the Brazilian Beneficent Association for Rehabilitation.Lessa is also under investigation for the execution of two individuals that allegedly took place during a police operation in the Parque Colúmbia favela in September 2000.	Ronnie Lessa, a former military police officer, has died in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, aged 87.
 Players of John Company will consider some of the issues that affected the historical EIC between 1710 and the 1860s. For instance, players must decide whether or not to try and conquer the Indian kingdoms; if they do, they may install a Governor-General, and traffic the opium they control to China. Players may hire Indians to assist them; these include Sikhs, the Jagat Seth family, Awadh, Arcot, Orissa, the Nizam of Hyderabad, and a Rajput prince. Meanwhile, Indians may revolt against the Company; in the real world, this led to the EIC's downfall, due to the Indian Revolt of 1857. The exact setup rules depend on the scenario the players choose, reflecting the historical fortunes of India and the EIC. For the 1710 or long 1710 scenarios, the Company has no debt, weak armies, and no ships. If the game starts in 1758, the Calico Acts will already have been passed, there is a governor in Bengal, the Company is already in debt, and Mysore and Bombay are stronger than in 1710. For an 1813 scenario, the Company has larger armies and more ships, while Bombay is weaker but the Punjab stronger. The laws players consider voting on also reflect historical fact. One card in the deck represents the Calico Acts; historically, these banned imports of cotton (as the EIC had been doing) and helped the rise and industrialization of the British cotton industry. If passed, the game card simulates this by reducing Company profits and allowing players to buy extra workshops while rewarding those who already have them; it also has support in Parliament, which reflects how MPs represented local economies dependent on textiles, while the rents of many Lords were connected to the wool industry. The Writer Privileges law, on the other hand, has less support in Parliament, but allows the players to gain extra money from trading in India, and makes future votes to deregulate the Company easier; a historical note on the card explains that reducing restrictions led to cheaper prices for Indian goods in Britain, which led to more support for deregulation. Players may also debate whether to recruit sepoys (Indian soldiers), extend the franchise (reducing the value of rotten boroughs and making it more expensive to buy votes), or provide relief for famines in India. These reflect issues Britain and the EIC faced in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the Reform Act 1832, Chartism, and several famines which affected India. One of the game's topics is the relationship between the EIC's actions in India and British culture then and now, and how reliant Britain was on its empire. For example, if the Company is successful, players will have more money and votes with which to influence Parliament; but whether it is or not, its violent actions will inevitably affect on its own culture.

 Both the Flyers and Islanders, two expansion teams established in 1967 and 1972, respectively, saw success and winning early into their franchises histories, something unusual among most expansion franchises in NHL history. By the time the two teams met for their first playoff matchup in the 1975 semifinals, the Flyers had just won the Stanley Cup in the previous season, in just their seventh season of existence. The Islanders were making their first playoff appearance in just their third season of existence. The Islanders had advanced to the semifinals after becoming the second team in NHL history to come back from a 3–0 series deficit, as they defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins in seven games. In the series, the Flyers, the first seed, jumped to a 3–0 series lead over the Islanders. However, the Islanders responded by winning the next three games to force a game seven, but unlike their quarterfinal matchup, they were unable to complete the comeback, as the Flyers prevailed in game seven, 4–1. The Flyers advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals and defeated the Buffalo Sabres to win their second straight Stanley Cup. Both teams would continue to be playoff contenders for the remainder of the decade.	Both the Flyers and Islanders were two expansion teams established in 1967 and 1972 .

" After the release of X&Y (2005), Coldplay decided to build their own recording studio. Chris Martin commented their former workplace ""felt a little dirty"" and the band ""weren't really speaking to each other. We all had our corner office in a big tower block, but there was no vibe"". Furthermore, they bought an old bakery in 2006 to help them refocus and established it as their headquarters. The building is intercalated between ""an estate agent and tiny restaurant"". Will Champion described it as a ""giant version"" of Jonny Buckland's room in Camden Road, from when the group studied at University College London. Producer Rik Simpson helped them to convert the place into a studio, which has their management offices above it and is ""good for overdubs"", but hard to do ""full band recordings""."

" The renovations made by Robertson Ward from 1934 to 1935 converted both structures from an Italianate design to the Regency Revival style and also architecturally harmonized the two buildings. Ward added a loggia with columns and wall details including blind arches and paired pilasters supporting a frieze, cornice and pediment to the forecourt, which was separated from the street by a unique iron fence decorated with anchors and drafting tools that extended in front of No. 150. Lanterns on the sides of the front gate to the forecourt depict ""150"" and ""152"" to represent the house numbers of the complex. The front doorway to No. 152 is raised four steps from the ground and has glass side lights with delicate pilasters supporting a molded entablature and a transom; iron trellises were used in lieu of columns to support a scalloped bronze canopy covering the stoop. The front façade of the house has double-hung sash windows with black shutters and includes a frieze and a cornice crowned by a brick parapet. A formal garden was located behind No. 150, which contained a patch of grass edged with boxwood and was surrounded by pathways, shrubs and trees."	renovations made by Robertson Ward from 1934 to 1935 converted both structures from an Italianate design to the Regency Revival style.

 The competition consisted of 80 teams: 48 championship division teams and 32 open division teams. Each of these divisions were further divided into two equal sized divisions for men and women. The championship division divided teams into eight groups of three teams each while the open division divided teams into four groups of four teams each, both engaging in a round-robin tournament that determined teams able to advance to a knockout stage. Pool play games were two 40-minute halves, separated by a seven-minute halftime and utilized the three points for a win system. After group stage play, the two highest ranked teams from each group advanced to their respective knockout stage. In the championship division, the third placed team advanced to a consolation bracket while in the open division, the third and fourth placed teams were eliminated. Knockout stage games also consisted of two 40-minute halves. The round of 16 and quarterfinals were separated by a seven-minute halftime while the semifinals and finals had a ten-minute halftime. Knockout stage games needed to declare a winner, therefore if a game was tied at the end of regulation, one 15-minute, golden-goal overtime period would begin. If still tied after overtime, kicks from the mark would determine the winner.	A competitive recreational game involving teams of four or more players, divided into two divisions.
 Henry Ross, who is believed to be the designer of the Eureka Flag, was from Toronto, Canada. The Swiss-born Charles Doudiet, whose sketchbook is held by the Art Gallery of Ballarat and contains such scenes from around the time of the armed uprising as the iconic Eureka Slaughter, had lived in Canada. Doudiet may have been present at the battle, and he notes in his sketchbook that he helped to convey his friend, the mortally wounded Ross, to the Free Trade Hotel, where the Eureka flag bearer died of a groin injury two days later. Robert Julien died defending the stockade, as did Thomas Budden, also a friend of Ross, both from Canada.	Two of the men who carried the Eureka flag at the Battle of the Somme in 1788 may have been Canadian, according to new research.
 After teenager Ann Somerton's father Andrew is killed during construction of the new Windsor Line for the London Underground, her mother Lilian receives a substantial amount of compensation. Ann, her mother and her mother's new boyfriend - Neville Chandler, who Ann believes is only interested in getting the large insurance pay-out - are invited to join the Mayor's party on the line's maiden train. Passing through a tunnel, Ann sees a vision of her father as one of a gang of ragged workers and faints. This draws the attention of a journalist from the Daily Globe, who begins to investigate. No-one believes her story, but Ann begins dreaming of her father, begging her to help. She returns to the line alone and has another vision, this time seeing her father being beaten by sinister figures. Desperate to find more, she visits her father's old friend Mr. Carstairs, an expert on the Underground, and learns of the old Prince Albert line in the same place decades before, which was covered up after a tunnel collapsed. Meanwhile, the journalist and his photographer venture into the tunnels, only to vanish. Ann spots a photograph of Victorian industrialist Lord Vicary in a magazine, and recognises him as the ringleader in her visions, and - despite her mother's increasingly histrionic attempts to get her to stop her daughter's obsession - returns to the Windsor Line after speaking to Globe editor Franklin, who instigates a police search of the tunnel. However, while Ann sees the two newsmen now among the workers, the police don't. After a spell committed to Stapleton Clinic, Ann pretends there was nothing behind her visions, and requests a visit to Vicary Hall, now a stately home that allows guided tours. She discovers Vicary conducted secretive botanical experiments and had a dim view of the growing worker's rights movement before disappearing in the Prince Albert Line disaster. Ann is later able to return to the Windsor Line in secret, but is accosted by the demonic Vicary before escaping with the help of an Underground worker. She follows them back to the ruins of the Albert Line. Using his botany research, Vicary and his right-hand thug Brock have prolonged their own lives and kidnapped her father and his workmates as well as others to build them an underground town. Ann is captured too, and finds Vicary is using drugs to keep control. With the aid of Vicary's abused maid Lucy, Ann is able to get to her father. The police meanwhile are drilling in the Underground as they search for Ann, having found a picture taken by the photographer that corroborates her story. Falling masonry kills Vicary as he prepares to attack Ann. The captives are freed, while those exposed to Vicary's drug are found an island where they can live, with the government covering the incident up so they can live in peace. Andrew returns to his family, sending Neville packing, and Ann has her father back.	The story of a teenager whose father was killed during the Windsor Line disaster has been revealed by the Daily Globe.
 Entering service on 22 April 1985 on the Bluemull Sound service, taking over from the original MV Geira, which was then sold out of the fleet. She operated alone on the Gutcher, Yell - Belmont, Unst - Oddsta, Fetlar service until 1988 when she was joined by MV Fylga. Once the two new Yell ferries were introduced in 2004, MV Bigga replaced Fylga on the service. This is the same year that the Fetlar terminal changed from Oddsta to Hamars Ness. Due to a vessel change, on 3 October 2005, Fivla was relegated to the fleet relief vessel, which she still operates as today. Each month she covers a different ro-ro ferry in the fleet so that they can go for their annual refit. She also covers any breakdowns that occur across the fleet. The only rest the ferry gets is when she goes for her own annual refit, normally on the Malakoff slip in Lerwick. On 28 April 2010, while carrying out refit cover in Yell Sound, she was trapped underneath the linkspan in Toft. This was due to four preventer chains on the linkspan snapping simultaneously from the low spring tides and the lower freeboard of the relief vessel. Due to this, during the following days (29 April and 4 May 2010), she operated a special service between Vidlin and Ulsta, Yell. == References ==	Fiva, a ro-ro ferry which operated alone on the Isle of Wight's Yell and Fetlar ferries, has taken over from the original MV Geira.
 The building has three levels, developing on a rectangular floor plan 40 m long and 13 m wide. On the east front, it has a columned portico developed on five round arches, placed asymmetrically, with a wooden trussed ceiling. The top floor consists of a loggia extending across the entire surface of the villa, covered by wooden trusses supporting the roof pitches. A cross-vaulted cellar extends only partially over a square portion of the roof. The only vertical connection prior to the 20th century restoration (which saw the introduction of a three-flight internal staircase) was the external staircase in the forepart at the end of the southern façade. Some frescoes preserved inside the ladies' room constitute a very rare example of the depiction of the leisure and occupations of the ladies of the court: they depict moments of the mistress's day, from waking up accompanied by music, to playing chess, to preparing the nuptial bed. They are considered one of the best Lombard fresco cycles of the entire 15th century.	A 15th Century villa built in the Italian style, it is one of the best examples of its kind in the country and has been the subject of a major restoration project in the 20th century.
" News of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces. The threat of mutiny was rife. Admiral Reinhard Scheer and Ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the ""valour"" of the German Navy. In northern Germany, the German Revolution of 1918–1919 began at the end of October 1918. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost, initiating the uprising. The sailors' revolt, which then ensued in the naval ports of Wilhelmshaven and Kiel, spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918, shortly thereafter to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and to German surrender."

" In poem 3.13 Sulpicia calls herself ""Sulpicia daughter of Servius"" (Servi filia Sulpicia), and in poem 3.13 she addresses Messalla (presumably Tibullus's patron Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, consul in 31 BC) as propinque ""relative"". On this basis Haupt (1871) identified Sulpicia as the granddaughter of Cicero's friend, Servius Sulpicius Rufus (consul 51 BC), who died in 43 BC, whose son is said to have married Messalla's sister. If so, Sulpicia would have been Messalla's niece. Some scholars write that she was Servius Sulpicius Rufus's daughter; if so, this would make Messalla her brother-in-law. Cērinthus, from the Greek κήρινθος ""bee bread"", is thought to be a synonym. Because of the similarity of consonants (c, r, n, t), as well as the metrical equivalence of the two names, and the resemblance between Greek κέρας keras ""horn"" and Latin cornu ""horn"", it has been suggested that Cerinthus may be the same as the friend, Cornutus, to whom Tibullus addresses a birthday poem (Tibullus 2.2), as well as a longer poem (2.3). The close verbal echoes between 2.2 and the some of the poems in the Garland (see below) are also suggestive that the works are in some way connected and that Cornutus and Cerinthus are the same person. One suggestion (if the Garland dates from the time of Tibullus) is that the Garland may have been written to celebrate the anniversary of Sulpicia and Cornutus's marriage."	The Greek poets Sulpicia and Cerintus may be the same persons as the relatives of Tibullus, according to a new study.
 The period before menstruation, known as the premenstrual phase, is often linked to emotional distress. Conditions related to the menstrual cycle encompass premenstrual tension syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and the exacerbation of another medical condition during the premenstrual phase. Menstruation is linked to a range of psychopathological symptoms, such as lower self-esteem, increased anxiety, dysphoria, and feelings of being persecuted. Changes in behavior, like decreased social interaction during menstruation, can lead to feelings of loneliness and potentially contribute to the development of depression. Several reviews have reported that psychopathological symptoms and mental disorders, such as psychoses, suicidal tendencies, post-traumatic stress disorder, and addictive behaviors, tend to worsen during menstruation. Variations in ovarian hormone levels are also linked to the presence of symptoms related to eating disorders. Some comprehensive studies have indicated that women might be at a higher risk of suicide during menstruation. The symptoms occurring during menstruation can have a significant impact on mental health and lead to severe consequences.

 According to a sakhi, Guru Hargobind once chastised a Sikh for becoming distracted whilst reciting gurbani. Guru Har Rai, the seventh Guru, emphasized the importance of not even changing a single word of gurbani and taught the correct pronunciation of it. In 1706, after the Battle of Muktsar, the army of Guru Gobind Singh camped at Sabo Ki Talwandi, now known as Takht Sri Damdamā Sahib. For nine months, Guru Gobind Singh, Baba Deep Singh, and Bhai Mani Singh scribed an entire volume of the Guru Granth Sahib in a volume known as the Damdama Bir. During this period, Guru Gobind Singh preformed katha of the entirety of the scripture, as well as teaching the proper recitation, or santhiya. This exact bir (copy) was later given the gurgaddi as the 11th Guru of the Sikhs. That year, Guru Gobind Singh is said to have founded a distinguished school of exegesis, later headed up by Baba Deep Singh. Damdamā Sahib was considered to be the highest seat of learning for the Sikhs during the 18th century, and the Damdami Taksal claims direct historical ties to Guru Gobind Singh, who entrusted it with the responsibility of teaching the reading (santhyā), analysis (vichār) of the Sikh scriptures.	Gurbani, or recitation of the Guru Granth Sahib, is one of the most important prayers of the Sikhs and has been taught for centuries.
" In 1918, Wimble built a small ship at Hastings with help from a friend and sailed to the West Indies to seek his fortune after his family faced financial hardship. In 1922, he acquired land in the Bahamas which enabled him to begin trading with the English colonies in mainland North America. He also acquired land in North Carolina, which was formally granted to him by George Burrington's council on August 4, 1723. Wimble later moved to Boston, Massachusetts where he married Rebecca Waters, the daughter of a prominent local, on March 26, 1724. Their first son, James, was born on December 20, 1724. He owned land in the South End which he presumably operated as a distillery. While in Boston, he continued his business of moving trade goods between North Carolina and various British trade posts in the West Indies. This business enabled him to increase his land holdings in North Carolina and purchase a brigantine, which he named ""Rebecca"" after his wife. In 1932, Wimble lost his ship and all of its cargo to a hurricane after being forced by Governor Woodes Rogers of the Bahamas to use his ship to protect vessels and salt ponds in Rum Cay. Wimble was forced to sell a portion of his belongings, land, and slaves to cover the loss and began the process of trying to collect damages from Woodes Rogers' commandeering of his ship."	James Wimble, who was born in the English colony of Sussex in 1723, travelled to the West Indies to seek a better life for his family.
 Barbary pirates were pirates who began their operations in the early 17th century in the Mediterranean Sea. Subsequently, they experienced substantial growth in their activities, leading to an increase in their popularity. During the early 17th century, the Dutch Republic embarked on an extensive territorial expansion, solidifying its dominant position as a major maritime power. Concurrently, it established a vast presence in international trade, making significant inroads in global commerce. The Dutch strategically established colonies and trading posts across various continents, including Asia, Africa, and the Americas, facilitating the flourishing exchange of valuable commodities, ranging from spices and textiles to precious metals. As a result of these endeavors, the Dutch Republic emerged as one of the foremost trading nations of that era, commanding a pervasive influence across the seas. The Dutch Republic displayed robust activity in the Mediterranean Sea engaging in frequent trade within the region. They established significant trade ties with countries situated along the Mediterranean coast, forging commercial relationships that were characterized by regular exchanges of goods and commodities. The Dutch's active presence in the Mediterranean facilitated the flow of various valuable products, further contributing to their status as a major trading nation during this period. The Dutch, who were known for their economic prosperity and active engagement in trade, found itself as a target of Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean Sea These pirates, seeking to plunder the wealth carried by Dutch ships, engaged in acts of harassment and attacks. Consequently, in 1618, the Dutch authorities responded by declaring war on both Tunisia and Algiers.

 Incorporating elements of animation, sculpture, and sound, Nathalie Djurberg and Hans Berg construct scenarios rich in psychological tension, exploring both human and primal desires. Djurberg, since 2001, has cultivated a unique filmmaking style marked by clay animation, through which she articulates fundamental instincts such as jealousy, vengeance, avarice, submission, and lust. Since 2004, Djurberg has been working as an artistic duo with her collaborator, musician and composer Hans Berg, complementing Djurberg's animations and installations with his atmospheric sound effects and entrancing musical scores. Djurberg and Berg frequently construct mentally disconcerting environments in their films and sculptural installations. Their main characters, often depicted as girls or young women, are described by The New York Times as engaging in a spectrum of malevolent activities. These range from mild deceit and amicable torture, to curiously innocuous bestiality, and at the extreme, murder and chaos. == References ==	Actress Nathalie Djurberg and composer Hans Berg have been named as the makers of the world's best-known film-making duo.
" The mining companies that were involved, and most prominent in the Vancouver Islands at the time, were: The Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Limited, the Western Fuel of San Francisco, the Pacific Coast Collieries, and the Nanaimo Coal Company. The Canadian Collieries were based in Cumberland and Extension. Owned by the Dunsmuir family, the company played a significant role in the strike by firing a union leader with the last name ""Mottishaw"". This was one of the strike's leading causes. The Western Fuel of San Francisco was based in Nanaimo and owned many of the mines there. The Pacific Coast Collieries only had minor involvement, and were located in South Wellington. The Nanaimo Coal Company stands apart from the other three, as it was the sole company to ""sign an agreement with the union. ""These mining companies (excluding the Nanaimo Coal Company) were opposed to the unions, because they were a threat to the coal companies' power and authority. They coal companies were also dealing with the competition of fuel oil. Because of the potential replacement of coal as fuel with oil as fuel, they worked the miners extra hard and with less pay. This was in an effort to keep up with fuel oil and to stay in business. They needed to pay workers less in order to make a profit. However, unions demanded more pay, causing an issue for the coal companies. They did not want to increase the miners' pay, at the risk of losing their business, and of the entire coal mining industry being replaced by an alternate fuel source. They also had the support of the government, because the economy was so dependent upon the coal industry."	A mining company that has been involved in a mining strike has been identified. The mining company has been characterized as having played a significant role in the strike by firing a union leader with the last name with the last name with the last name.
 The site was split in two by the modern road. The buildings were placed around a large central peristyle (courtyard) garden. The residential part (pars urbana) of the villa with a grand facade overlooking the sea is on the eastern side. On the western side of the peristyle (and the modern road) is a richly decorated large private double bath complex. The monumental baths are as big as many ancient public baths, but their richness and magnificence of decoration are more consistent with private baths in this location. Their external appearance would also have been impressive as the roofs were vaulted and domed. The two independent bath suites is a feature of other 4th century villas and may have been influenced by Christianity, which banned mixed bathing and promoted modesty among the newly converted. Other possible parts such as the pars rustica (for servants and other workers) and the pars fructaria (for the processing of products) typical of a Roman villa have not yet been found.	The ruins of a 4th century Roman villa have been discovered on the Greek island of Kos in the Aegean Sea near the city of Kos.
" A pre-company is a trading combination from the Republic that traded in Asia between 1594 and 1602, before the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was founded. The pre-companies were financed by wealthy Northern Netherlands merchants and wealthy immigrants from the Southern Netherlands. Because of the cutthroat competition, the companies were forced in 1602 by the government to unite for 21 years in the VOC, which was given exclusive right to trade in Asia.Before the VOC (I+J+K+L) was founded in 1602, 12 different pre-companies existed in the space of 7 years: According to a contemporary, ""people sailed each other's money out of the purse and the shoes off their feet"". A total of fifteen expeditions were sent out between 1594 and 1601 in which 65 ships took part, including four ships of the ""First Dutch Expedition to East Indies"", and excluding the three barre and failed trips through the North Cape."	The Dutch East India Company (VOC) was founded in 1602 by a merger of 12 Dutch pre-companies, which traded in Asia between 1594 and 1602.
 In 1541, 1542 or 1543 (sources differ) Portugal established contact with Japan. Japan was then involved in a long civil-war but since Ming China had officially cut relations with Japan meant that Portuguese merchants could serve as an profitable commercial intermediary between the two nations. In 1550, the Portuguese Crown created an official trade route linking Goa, capital of its holdings in Asia, and Japan, and every year one or a number of large tradeships would sail to Japan and back, commanded by a captain-major. The Portuguese found enthusiastic commercial and diplomatical partners among Japanese lords and some, like Ōtomo Sōrin and Ōmura Sumitada converted to Christianity. Instability in Japan, or other reasons, meant that the Portuguese would occasionally be drawn into internal Japanese conflicts.	The Portuguese Crown has become the world's largest trade agency, which makes it a gateway to Japan.
" In 1577, William Camden (1551–1623) began his great work Britannia, a topographical and historical survey of all of Great Britain and Ireland. His stated intention was to ""restore antiquity to Britaine, and Britain to his antiquity"". The first edition, written in Latin, was published in 1586. It proved very popular, and ran through five further Latin editions, of 1587, 1590, 1594, 1600 and 1607, each greatly enlarged from its predecessor in both textual content and illustrations. The 1607 edition included for the first time a full set of English county maps, based on the surveys of Christopher Saxton and John Norden, and engraved by William Kip and William Hole (who also engraved the fine frontispiece). The first English-language edition, translated by Philemon Holland, appeared in 1610, again with some additional content supplied by Camden. Britannia is a county-by-county description of Great Britain and Ireland. It is a work of chorography: a study that relates landscape, geography, antiquarianism, and history. Rather than write a history, Camden wanted to describe in detail the Great Britain of his time, and to show how the traces of the past could be discerned in the existing landscape. By this method, he produced the first coherent picture of Roman Britain."	Britannia, one of the most important books in English history, is celebrating its 350th anniversary this year. and is being celebrated by the National Library of England.
 In 2006, a photo of an unidentified, large, monocarpic, fan palm in Madagascar was posted on PalmTalk, the society’s online forum. This photo led botanists to the site and to the discovery and description of a monotypic genus new to science, Tahina, which was published in 2008. The PalmTalk community subsequently spearheaded a drive to raise funds for its conservation. In 2020, the IPS launched its annual Save the Species campaign to raise awareness and funding for targeted palm conservation projects around the world. Save the Species target projects have included: 2020 Madagascar: Tahina spectabilis in partnership with Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. 2021 Colombia: Sabinaria magnifica in partnership with SalvaMontes. 2022 Hawaii: Pritchardia woodii in partnership with the National Tropical Botanic Garden. 2023 UK: Ravenea moorei in partnership with Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.	The International Society for the Protection of Palm Endangered (IPS) was established by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
 The sculpture consist of two sphinxes, with the left missing its head. Found in fragments initially, the stele was broken from side to side, along with the forelegs, which were subsequently repaired. The lower portion is decorated with a frieze of palmettes, egg, and dart, characteristic of 5th century BC style, with portions of the stele maintaining its original polychromy with red-brown pigment. Both sphinxes are faced back to back, gazing out in three-quarters perspective. The intact sphinx has its hair intact and long, pulled back on the sides, but covering her ears, and wears a crown consisting of circles and merlons, the back of the stele is roughed out with its bottom half broken off. The sphinx motif on the stele indicates it's prominence in cult objects, as prior to the stele's approximate creation, in the mid 5th century BC, the depiction was also seen in the Amathus sarcophagus, considered the most significant object in the Cesnola collection alongside the stele, famous for its preserved polychromy. == References ==	The sculpture consist of two sphinxes, with the left missing its head.

" Compared to Southeastern China, the Dongbei or Northeast region of China was settled by Han Chinese relatively recently, only in the past 200 years or so, during a migration movement referred to as Chuang Guandong. Jia Xingjia, a Chinese essayist, compared this expansion to the Western Expansion of the United States, in which the Northeast was seen by China as a sort of cultural blank slate. Many of these migrants abandoned their hometowns and left behind their folk traditions and languages. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Northeast was an industrial hotbed of China. State-owned industrial operations guaranteed lifetime employment to blue-collar workers, the ""iron rice bowl."" During this time, it was the most urbanized area of China, and boasted the country's most extensive rail network. Communities were organized around factories which provided not just employment, but also a community to their workers, such as in state-owned cultural palaces, which could serve as movie theaters, libraries, chess rooms, and stadiums, among other roles. These palaces and their decline are a common element of Dongbei renaissance works, and could be seen as a communist analogue to the capitalist dead mall: a once-vibrant physical community center that has become outmoded with economic decline and the rise of Internet-based communities. Economic reforms in 1990s China led to privately-owned businesses outcompeting state enterprises. Corruption and increased competition caused state-owned manufacturing plants to decline, and their employees were laid off en masse. The resulting economic depression in these areas created urban decay. The northeast, more so than other regions, was both economically and culturally enmeshed with the Communist state. As a result, it struggled to adapt to a liberalized China."	Dongbei is one of the most densely-populated regions of China, and has been the subject of a series of urban renewal projects.
" The building of the museum was originally a house established by a merchant named ""Abd al-Jabbar al-Khudairi"" in the late 19th century. It at one point belonged to Halil Kut of the Ottoman Empire. The house became a distinguished heritage building in terms of planning, architectural elements, distinguished woodwork, shanasheel, and the neighborhoods where the house was located. The Ministry of Tourism maintained the house and revived it as a heritage museum for Abd-al Karim Qasim. The museum contains Qasim's personal belongings and rare gifts. After maintenance, the museum was opened on the 9th of February, 2015, and was attended by his family and loved ones, as well as official, academic and cultural figures. The museum was opened to preserve the history of the country so that future generations can be aware of it. It also hinted that a similar museum in Basra dedicated to poet Badr Shakir al-Sayyab could be opened. The museum includes five halls, the first of which included the personal belongings of the leader, and the other was allocated for gifts, weapons, archives, and documents."

 Danny Budd is rejected by the Royal Marines due to his lack of height. An orphan, he lives with his sneering Uncle Fred and oafish cousin Ron in Northern town Tynecastle. Danny works as an underappreciated role as assistant to Fred's coal delivery business, and longs to be a Bootneck like his late father. After being spotted in a scuffle by a Marines recruiting officer, Danny is signed up. While his small stature makes him the butt of jokes his determination and courage soon shine through, especially when defending the barracks from a Luftwaffe raid. Despite further clashes with Fred, Ron and a brash company of Rangers deployed to the town he successfully completes training, and is deployed to the 1942 landings in North Africa. Danny is later selected for SBS missions in the Aegean Sea and fighting along partisans on Crete and in raids in Yugoslavia. Later his unit were selected to work with Soviet marines in the Black Sea, fighting in the Crimea over the winter of 1943. In 1944 he was assigned to special unit Striker Force for the Anzio landings; Danny was injured during the battle and sent on leave in Britain, ending up foiling an escape by German prisoners-of-war. He was later assigned to the Normandy landings force, coming ashore at Juno Beach. Danny fought in the Liberation of Paris and the push to Antwerp.

" It was established on 4 July 2022, with the purpose of expressing opposition to the French presence in Operation Barkhane, which the group perceives as a ""French military presence in Niger""; the group views it as a form of invasion. During these protests, participants used the flags of Russia and Niger as symbols. Protests continued as of 19 September 2022, and certain slogans emerged, such as ""France is a Nazi State! "", ""The colonial army (Barkhane) must leave"", and ""Pull the French colonial army out"". Many protesters also wore shirts depicting the Z symbol used during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The leader of M62, Abdoulaye Seydou, has denied any links with the Russian government, stating that ""We are fighting for Niger's sovereignty, so we are not with any foreign country partners"", and said protest organizers confiscated Russian flags brought by protesters. In an interview with The Irish Times, he described Thomas Sankara as an ""idol"" for his opposition to neocolonialism. Seydou was arrested by the government of Mohamed Bazoum just one day after the interview. During the 2023 Nigerien coup d'état against Bazoum, the group marched in support of the coup.

"", ""Arrest the former dignitaries to return the stolen millions"", and ""Down with France, long live Putin!"" The demonstrators also called for an immediate intervention by the Russian paramilitary Wagner Group. During the march, the entrances to the French and American embassies were closed.

 The watershed of what is just called the Winter brook encompasses entirely the watershed of the Winter brook, Big brook, Black Water, and Hulpe. The source area of the Winter brook is in Korspel, a hamlet of Beringen. In the downstream direction to the west, three streams combine to contribute to the flow of the Winter brook, among them the Genemeer brook. As a result of mine subsidence, the water management in this source area was disturbed, leading to the reversal of the flow direction of the Genemeer brook, which ceased to join the Winter brook. As a result, a new connection was established from the source area of this stream to Winter brook. Between the villages of Beverlo and Beringen Mine, the brook flows westward, guided through a siphon under the Albert Canal. It now continues southwestward, passing to the north of the Paalse Lake and southeast of Tessenderlo and Deurne. Until this stage, it falls within the classification as a second-class non-navigable watercourse. Near the Paalse Lake, it becomes a watercourse of the first category due to high pollution. Further downstream, Small brook and Middle brook (Dutch:Middelbeek) run parallel to the Winter brook, and the name changes to Big brook. The valley with these parallel running streams is known as the Valley of the Three Brooks. The brook flows south of Deurne, along the area of Asdonk. When the Small brook merges into the Big brook, the name changes to Black Water. This name is given to the dark color that the water acquires due to the presence of peat soil. Beyond Molenstede, there is another name change, and the brook becomes the Hulpe, named after a significant side stream that joins it. Under the name Hulpe, it flows through the Demer Marshes before finally joining the Demer River. In the western part of the watershed, the valley is flanked by escarpments composed of iron sandstone. These escarpments are up to 30 meters higher than their surroundings.	Winter brook is a watercourse in the Dutch province of Beringen.

" A pre-company is a trading combination from the Republic that traded in Asia between 1594 and 1602, before the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was founded. The pre-companies were financed by wealthy Northern Netherlands merchants and wealthy immigrants from the Southern Netherlands. Because of the cutthroat competition, the companies were forced in 1602 by the government to unite for 21 years in the VOC, which was given exclusive right to trade in Asia.Before the VOC (I+J+K+L) was founded in 1602, 12 different pre-companies existed in the space of 7 years: According to a contemporary, ""people sailed each other's money out of the purse and the shoes off their feet"".

" In 2011, The Alaska Design Forum, in collaboration with the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), embarked on a public art project that aimed to ignite conversations about shared spaces. This project resulted in a giant banner with the words ""Looking For Love Again"" hanging on the west face of the Polaris Building. The project sought to engage the public in a meaningful way and was designed by Candy Chang, a graphic and urban designer known for her work in struggling communities. The project featured two chalkboards at the base of the building, inviting passersby to share their memories and hopes related to the Polaris Building. Drawing inspiration from a similar endeavor in New Orleans, Candy Chang sought to evoke a sense of community ownership and empowerment by encouraging individuals to articulate their desires for their neighborhood.

 The economy prior to the eighteenth century was essentially a subsistence economy, which was also very much subject to the vagaries of geopolitics, which meant that attention was focused on ways of allocating resources to activities that produced food or strengthened the means of defence. As a result, cultural activities that detracted from production, defence or religion were generally viewed with suspicion, except by mercantilists, who saw them as a way of improving the trade balance. Cultural activities were seen as deeply linked to the passions, and as an expression of vices such as jealousy, envy, pride and lust, they were seen as something to be fought. So when Jean Bodin ranked city dwellers in order of social merit in 1576, he placed artists at the bottom. Even Bernard Mandeville, for whom the organisation of selfish passions is the driving force behind economic growth, only advises indulging in the arts as a means of avoiding other, more costly extravagances.However, both of these authors were interested in the problem of determining the price of works of art. For Bodin, the value of works of art or luxury items was essentially determined by demand, which in turn was linked to trends. Anticipating Veblen, he highlighted the conspicuous consumption dimension of the artistic demand of his time: it was all about flaunting one's wealth. Mandeville, for his part, also noted that an artist's reputation and the social position of his buyers had a major influence on the value placed on his work. To these determinants, he adds rarity, but also the conformity of the work to its model. In this, he agrees with Jean Bodin and Ferdinando Galiani that the fundamental value of art lies in its ability to highlight and exalt the true nature of its model and to educate viewers about virtue through its power to represent elevated feelings.	The present invention relates to the field of economics, and more particularly to the field of trade.
 In July 2022, the conflict in Blue Nile State flared up in the Wad el-Mahi locality due to a land dispute that erupted between the Hausa on one side, and Berta and Funj on the other. The violence in July was partially triggered by these land conflicts and aggravated by political rivalries. This resurgence of violence follows an earlier outbreak in mid-July, where intercommunal clashes claimed numerous lives and forced thousands to flee to safer areas. The conflict's humanitarian impact has been severe, with approximately 235,000 individuals displaced and seeking refuge in makeshift shelters, including schools and nearby camps. The closure of markets due to the ongoing violence has left local residents struggling to meet their basic needs, while government offices remain shuttered.The clashes have led to protests across Sudan, particularly among the Hausa community, who are demanding justice for the victims. These protests have also shed light on issues of racism and marginalisation, as the Hausa community in Sudan, part of the Hausa ethnic group from West Africa, have been perceived as outsiders in Sudan. == References ==	In July 2022, the conflict in Blue Nile State flared up in the Wad el-Mahi locality due to a land dispute.

" People have willingly arranged to be buried alive, reportedly demonstrating their disputed ability to survive such an event for many centuries. The fear of being buried alive peaked during the cholera epidemics of the 19th century, but accounts of unintentional live burial have been recorded even earlier. Reports of doctors and accounts in literature heightened these fears. The subject is detailed in ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" and ""The Cask of Amontillado"", Edgar Allan Poe wrote ""The Premature Burial"", which was published in 1844. It contained accounts of supposedly genuine cases of premature burial and detailing the narrator's (perceived) interment while still alive. In 1822, German Dr. Adolf Gutsmuth was buried alive several times to demonstrate a safety coffin of his design, staying underground for several hours and eating a meal of soup, bratwurst, marzipan, sauerkraut, spätzle, beer, and for dessert, prinzregententorte, delivered to him through the coffin's feeding tube. In 1840, Sadhu Haridas, an Indian yogi, is said to have been buried for ten months. The yogi said that his only fear during his ""wonderful sleep"" was being eaten by underground worms. However, according to current medical science, a human can't survive for ten months without food, water, and air. According to other sources the entire burial was 40 days long. The Indian government has since made voluntary premature burial illegal because of the unintended deaths of individuals attempting to recreate this feat. In 1898, Russian Count Michel de Karnice-Karnicki invented a safety coffin called ""Le Karnice"". A long tube measuring 8.89 cm (3.5 in) in diameter was connected with an aperture in the coffin, with the other end emerging above ground (rather like the periscope of a submarine). Italian Faroppo Lorenzo consented to be buried in ""Le Karnice"". On 17 December 1898, he was buried and emerged on the 26th of December. Signor Lorenzo’s only comment, when dug up after this dismal underground Christmas vacation, was that it had been ""damned smelly down there""."

 The principle of the ethological halter seems to have been discovered by American Horse Whisperer Tom Dorrance. The American veterinarian Robert M. Miller believes that its use in the USA stems from the bosal hackamore of the Vaqueros, which has been adopted by almost all practitioners of natural horsemanship in the form of a rope halter with knots. According to Cynthia McFarland, American cowboys were the first to discover and make a rope halter. The use of this equipment spread from the United States to France in the early 2000s, as well as to Germany, accompanying the development of ethological equitation. French rider Michel Robert is a pioneer in the world of show jumping. Equestrian equipment manufacturers have adapted to demand. Many now offer this type of halter for sale, with a wide choice of models, colors and materials, and knots that can be placed in different ways. In the United States, the marketing of an ethological halter supposed to make horses softer, under the name of be-nice, has sparked debate.	An ethological halter with knots in the form of a rope halter with knots is used in ethological equitation.

 After teenager Ann Somerton's father Andrew is killed during construction of the new Windsor Line for the London Underground, her mother Lilian receives a substantial amount of compensation. Ann, her mother and her mother's new boyfriend - Neville Chandler, who Ann believes is only interested in getting the large insurance pay-out - are invited to join the Mayor's party on the line's maiden train. Passing through a tunnel, Ann sees a vision of her father as one of a gang of ragged workers and faints. This draws the attention of a journalist from the Daily Globe, who begins to investigate. No-one believes her story, but Ann begins dreaming of her father, begging her to help. She returns to the line alone and has another vision, this time seeing her father being beaten by sinister figures. Desperate to find more, she visits her father's old friend Mr. Carstairs, an expert on the Underground, and learns of the old Prince Albert line in the same place decades before, which was covered up after a tunnel collapsed. Meanwhile, the journalist and his photographer venture into the tunnels, only to vanish. Ann spots a photograph of Victorian industrialist Lord Vicary in a magazine, and recognises him as the ringleader in her visions, and - despite her mother's increasingly histrionic attempts to get her to stop her daughter's obsession - returns to the Windsor Line after speaking to Globe editor Franklin, who instigates a police search of the tunnel. However, while Ann sees the two newsmen now among the workers, the police don't. After a spell committed to Stapleton Clinic, Ann pretends there was nothing behind her visions, and requests a visit to Vicary Hall, now a stately home that allows guided tours. She discovers Vicary conducted secretive botanical experiments and had a dim view of the growing worker's rights movement before disappearing in the Prince Albert Line disaster. Ann is later able to return to the Windsor Line in secret, but is accosted by the demonic Vicary before escaping with the help of an Underground worker. She follows them back to the ruins of the Albert Line. Using his botany research, Vicary and his right-hand thug Brock have prolonged their own lives and kidnapped her father and his workmates as well as others to build them an underground town. Ann is captured too, and finds Vicary is using drugs to keep control. With the aid of Vicary's abused maid Lucy, Ann is able to get to her father. The police meanwhile are drilling in the Underground as they search for Ann, having found a picture taken by the photographer that corroborates her story. Falling masonry kills Vicary as he prepares to attack Ann. The captives are freed, while those exposed to Vicary's drug are found an island where they can live, with the government covering the incident up so they can live in peace. Andrew returns to his family, sending Neville packing, and Ann has her father back.	Substantial amount of compensation to her mother and her mother.
 According to legend, seeds of cannabis were brought to Naogaon District for cultivation from Jessore District before 1857 and were first planted. However, according to history, after the establishment of a cannabis hub in Naogaon, Bengal Presidency in 1906, the government of the British Raj started the first commercial cultivation of cannabis in the region Bengal. The government then appointed a registrar to collect revenue from the hub. In 1917, a cooperative society named the Ganja Society was established for the welfare of the 7,000 cannabis growers of Naogaon. The shares of the co-operative society were then sold to the farmers at the rate of ten rupees each, whereby the farmers became its partners. A warehouse was built there to store the produced cannabis. It was inaugurated in 1921 by Syed Nawab Ali Chowdhury, one of the provincial ministers of Bengal. In 1974, the government of Bangladesh signed the Geneva Conventions, which forced the government to withdraw from cannabis production. In 1975, the Ganja Society set up a 1,000 metric ton capacity cold storage facility with three chambers. According to the agreement, the activities of the Ganja Society came to a standstill in 1987 when the cultivation of cannabis was banned. After the ban was announced, the government locked up the Ganja Society's warehouses with manufactured cannabis.	According to legend, seeds of cannabis were brought to Naogaon District for cultivation from Jessore District before 1857 and were first planted . In 1906, the government of the British Raj started the first commercial cultivation of cannabis in the region Bengal . In 1917, a co-operative society named the Ganja Society was established for the welfare of the 7,000 cannabis growers . The shares of the society were then sold to farmers at the rate of ten rupees each, whereby the farmers became its partners .
 The main Swedish consumer cooperative organisation, Kooperativa Förbundet (KF), was founded in 1899, with the organisation being a dominant player in the Swedish market throughout the 20th century. The main brand of KF stores was Konsum, though it was one among many, with many different chains existing within the KF organisation. Ahead of the merger into Coop Norden KF centralised their branding under the Coop name in the early 2000s, with larger Konsum stores becoming Coop Konsum, and various hypermarket brands being centralised as Coop Forum.In 2015 the Coop chain was rebranded as part of a reorganisation within the KF organisation, with stores being branded under the Coop, Stora Coop and the short-lived Lilla Coop names.	The Coop is one of the largest chains of supermarkets in Sweden, with more than 1,000 stores across the country under the Coop and Stora Coop brands.
" Boskovich (1956–2006) studied at the California Institute of the Arts under the tutelage of conceptual artist John Baldessari. His work has been cited as drawing heavily from Dadaism, and frequently utilised objects, photography, handwritten and typeset texts and audio sources to create ""witty and sharp-edged social commentary"". Boskovich was in a relationship with Stephen Earabino, a fashion stylist originally from Massachusetts, with whom he lived in an apartment in Los Angeles, California. In 1995, Earabino died from AIDS-related complications. Shortly after his death, Earabino's family emptied out the flat Earabino shared with Boskovich, removing all of his items, as well as most of Boskovich's, with the only remaining item being an electric box fan."

 In 1995, a portion of the archipelago was declared a marine park under the Tanzania Marine parks Authority, a department of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism. The Islands are known as a major breeding ground for whale sharks. At a depth of less than 20 meters below mean tide levels is where more than half of the Mafia Island Marine Park, which has an area of 822 km2, is situated. The bulk of the marine park consists of other reef portions in south Bwejuu Island and the wide area south of the bay surrounded by Mafia, Jibondo, and Juani Islands. A magnificent mosaic of tropical marine ecosystems, including mangrove swamps, coral reefs, and seagrass meadows, may be found in the area. It also supports a huge diversity of fish and other top marine species. Two endangered kinds of sea turtles can find a home in the park. == References ==	In 1995, a portion of the archipelago was declared a marine park under the Tanzania Marine parks Authority, a department of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism .

 Digging of the shaft began on June 1, 1854, 835 metres from the Saint-Charles shaft, with a section measuring 5.1 metres by 2.5 metres. By September 1856, it had reached a depth of 93.60 metres. The water was drained (20 m3 per hour) using a ten-horsepower steam engine consisting of a horizontal cylinder and gears. This engine was used to drive the pumps and raise the skips of excavated material, while a horse-drawn engine was used to lower the equipment and carry out various manoeuvres. A casing was installed in the rectangular section. At 25.70 metres, the shaft was circular in cross-section and 3.20 metres in diameter. In September 1856, a 12-horsepower direct-drive steam engine accompanied by pumps was ordered from Le Creusot for dewatering; this equipment was operational in June 1857 and sinking resumed. The dewatering machine operated at a rate of seven or eight strokes per minute, but was capable of twelve strokes per minute if necessary. The water was pumped up through sheet metal pipes 24 centimetres in diameter.In May 1858, the installation of the dodecagonal casing, made up of sides 94 centimetres wide and a total height of 98.50 metres, was completed. However, the casing was fragile and eventually began to leak, so a small pump driven by a four-horsepower steam engine was installed 104 metres above the surface in June 1873. It collected between 100 and 120 m3 of water a day in a cofferdam.	The shaft of the Saint-Charles in southern France has reached a depth of 92.50 metres, according to the British Museum.
" Sharma's first ascent of Es Pontàs featured prominantly in the award-winning 2007 climbing film, King Lines, which became an iconic film in rock climbing. Images of Sharma soloing on the dramatic and overhanging arch above deep blue sea, adorned the covers of most climbing magazines, showcasing DWS to the global climbing community. In 2016, Rock & Ice said: ""The silhouette of Sharma on the underside of the Es Pontàs arch is an indelible image for climbers of the mid-2000s"". In a 2016 interview with Climbing, when DWS pioneer Miquel Riera was asked about the most impressive DWS ascent, he replied: ""Have you seen Chris Sharma on Es Pontàs? That should answer your question"". Sharma said of his ascent: ""... definitely a pivotal experience in my life that set me on an entirely new path in my life and in the world"". He also said: ""... deep water soloing embodies for me the perfect form of climbing. Take Es Pontàs for instance, it’s a route I put up in Mallorca. It's 5.15, but I can solo it. For me, that's as good as it gets"". Climbing considered his ascent of Es Pontàs as being another example of Sharma's talent for ""... the genius to see the potential, coupled with the commitment to spend months and years of his life proving it"". Climbing also noted that the ascent, and increased profile Sharma brought to DWS, as being another example of his influence on the development of the sport of modern rock climbing, saying: ""Sharma shaped modern rock climbing.

" On April 8, the Ottoman army passed Ochkhamuri, but did not go through the valley and took refuge in the forest between Ochkhamuri and Cholok. Mazniashvili ordered the armored train to retreat. The armored personnel carrier was supposed to be in the rearguard, but then he shared the plan of Vladimir Goguadze, the head of the armored personnel carrier: To break into the enemy's positions and conduct a battle. The battle began at five o'clock in the morning on April 7. An armored train broke into the ranks of the enemy. But the Georgian side did not open fire either from the train or from the trenches, because it had received such an order. Only the artillery, which was handed over to Kargaretli, opened fire on the opponent. Whether the Ottomans approached the train or not, they opened fire. The Georgians opened fire from the train as well as from trenches and trenches. The Ottoman soldiers found in the open field were killed in large numbers. After six hours of the battle, an Ottoman dragster hit the armored car and threw the first car of the train off the tracks, and another attack was made on the armored car by a new thousand from the west. Goguadze had run out of hope and pressed the button with which the armored personnel carrier was supposed to explode, the enemy would only be left with iron fragments, but the wire leading from the remote control to the mine was broken and the mine did not come into action. In the meantime, Akaki Urushadze, who was sent to ask for additional help, came to Mazniashvili and a 400-man detachment of the Gori Guard joined the battle. The Ottomans finally broke and began to retreat. The Georgians came out of the trenches and reached the fleeing enemy to the bridge of Ochkhamuri before 4 o'clock in the day. The Ottoman army retreated 4 kilometers. In the battle, 3 people were killed and 25 wounded on the Georgian side. On the side of the Ottomans, according to Mazniashvili's estimate, up to 500 people were killed, and according to other Georgian military leaders, up to 1000 people were killed. According to Dr. Vakhtang Gambashidze, the Ottomans were transporting 600 wounded soldiers to Batumi. According to ""Georgia"" newspaper, 80 were killed on the Ottoman side, 2 soldiers were captured. Georgians captured 20 rifles."	The present invention relates to the field of defense, and more particularly to the defeat of the enemy in the valley ofhkhamuri and the retreat of the army.

 North of Mbuamaji's old town (Currently called Gezaulole), on the seashore, is where the site is situated. A bulldozer has already damaged a portion of the site as of the early 2010s. There is a significant amount of both foreign and native cultural materials at the location. Dutch replicas of Chinese blue and white ceramics from the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as a Chinese blue and white potsherd, are examples of imported items. Other items include glass, red and white beads, Persian pottery, and red pottery from India that has black stripes painted on it. While some of the native pottery was painted in red or graphite, other pieces featured carved embellishments. The decorated ceramics are from the 12th–13th and 15th–16th centuries, respectively. A local potsherd was discovered to feature ornamental designs similar to those from Shungubweni and Pemba Mnazi. The abundance of both indigenous and imported cultural items sets the Mbuamaji site apart from all others north of Pemba Mnazi. Therefore, Mbuamaji ought to have been a very prosperous town. There is a rather modern mosque near the site with inscriptions from AH 1017 (1608 AD). Archaeologist Chittick's early research at the location reveals that the inscriptions were likely brought from another mosque because of the mosque's 19th-century Swahili architectural style. The inscriptions may be from an earlier mosque that once stood on the same spot, according to the updated dates for the location.	A bulldozer has already damaged a portion of the site as of the early 2010s.

" It was established on 4 July 2022, with the purpose of expressing opposition to the French presence in Operation Barkhane, which the group perceives as a ""French military presence in Niger""; the group views it as a form of invasion. During these protests, participants used the flags of Russia and Niger as symbols. Protests continued as of 19 September 2022, and certain slogans emerged, such as ""France is a Nazi State! "", ""The colonial army (Barkhane) must leave"", and ""Pull the French colonial army out"". Many protesters also wore shirts depicting the Z symbol used during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The leader of M62, Abdoulaye Seydou, has denied any links with the Russian government, stating that ""We are fighting for Niger's sovereignty, so we are not with any foreign country partners"", and said protest organizers confiscated Russian flags brought by protesters. In an interview with The Irish Times, he described Thomas Sankara as an ""idol"" for his opposition to neocolonialism. Seydou was arrested by the government of Mohamed Bazoum just one day after the interview. During the 2023 Nigerien coup d'état against Bazoum, the group marched in support of the coup. In a march at the request of Abdourahmane Tchiani, thousands of pro-coup Nigeriens gathered in Niamey's Concertation Square, in front of the National Assembly, and went to the French embassy carrying Nigerien and Russian flags, with slogans such as ""Down with France, out with Barkhane, we don't care about ECOWAS, the European Union and the African Union! "", ""Arrest the former dignitaries to return the stolen millions"", and ""Down with France, long live Putin!"" The demonstrators also called for an immediate intervention by the Russian paramilitary Wagner Group. During the march, the entrances to the French and American embassies were closed. The French embassy's walls and gates were set ablaze and damaged whilst Nigerien soldiers and General Salifou Modi were seen on the ground urging the crowds to disperse peacefully. == References =="	"M62 was established on 4 July 2022, with the purpose of expressing opposition to the French presence in Operation Barkhane, which the group perceives as a ""French military presence in Niger""; the group views it as a form of invasion .

" Angela of Metal.de compared 10 Year Anniversary: Live in Reykjavík to Skáldöld's previous live album, Skálmöld & Sinfóníuhljómsveit Íslands (2013), which was recorded with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra, and said the new album displays the band ""at its purest"". She said it reflects the experience of Skálmöld's regular concerts, with the audience singing along in Icelandic throughout the songs, a unique feature of shows in the band's home country. She said the setlist is a good selection from the band's five studio albums and should satisfy both old and new listeners, only missing the track ""Loki"" which otherwise often is part of the live sets. Carl Fisher of Games, Brrraaains & A Head-Banging Life wrote that the quality of the audio production sometimes makes it sound like a studio album, while at the same time, the audience can be heard clearly. Folk-metal.nl highlighted the audio production, and wrote that although the ""cold brooding air"" from the studio album Sorgir (2018) is not reproduced live, that is weighed up by the participation from the audience, which almost functions as a choir."	Folk-metal band Skálmöld have released their first live album in 10 years, and it has been well received by critics.

" Typically a skimmer draws water from the pool through a rectangular opening in the wall, at the top of the pool, connected through a device installed in one (or more) walls of the pool. The internal parts of the skimmer are accessed from the pool deck through a circular or rectangular cover, approximately one foot in diameter. If the pool's water pump is operational, it draws water from the pool through a hinged floating chute (which operates from a vertical position at a 90-degree angle to the pool, to prevent leaves and debris from being washed back into the pool by wave action), and down into a removable ""skimmer basket"", whose purpose is to catch leaves, dead insects and other larger floating debris. The opening visible from the side of the pool is usually 1'0"" (300 mm) wide by 6"" (150 mm) high, which cuts the water halfway down the center of the opening. Skimmers with wider openings are called ""wide angle"" skimmers and can be up to 2'0"" wide (600 mm). Floating skimmers have the advantage of not being affected by water level, as they adjust to work with the suction rate of the pump and will maintain optimal skimming regardless of water level, leading to a significantly reduced amount of biomaterial in the water. Skimmers should always have a leaf basket or filter between it and the pump to avoid clogging the pipes leading to the pump and filter."	A skimmer is a device that draws water from a swimming pool and uses it to catch floating debris, such as leaves, dead insects and other floating debris.
 Hiddensee is the largest island of the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park and combines an old cultural landscape with the heaths of the originally existing dune heath. The large new land formations in the northeast (Alter and Neuer Bessin) and south (am Gellen) of Hiddensee provide habitats for numerous invertebrates, such as worms and mussels. These then serve as food for many migratory birds. Thus, the island environment is one of the most important crane resting places in Germany. The southern tip of the island as well as the New Bessin have therefore been assigned to protection zone I of the National Park Vorpommersche Boddenlandschaft and may not be entered. There are two nature reserves on the island, the NSG Dünenheide between Neuendorf and Vitte and the NSG Dornbusch and Schwedenhagener Ufer in the north. The Hiddenseer Dünenheide is the largest coastal dune heath preserved in context in the German Baltic Sea region.In 1924, wild rabbits were released at the Dornbusch to enrich the hunt, which turned out to be a serious mistake. After only a few years, the animals had proliferated extraordinarily and the damage caused by game is still considerable today. In 1962, deer were also released on the island. Wild boars regularly come to the island from Rügen. In the mid-seventies, an elk was also sighted. Wood lizards, adders and grass snakes are also found on the island. The Naturschutzgesellschaft Hiddensee und Boddenlandschaft maintains a permanent exhibition on fauna and flora in Vitte in the national park house. From 1936 until around 2018, the Hiddensee ornithological station worked on the island, since then there is no longer an observation station here.	The island of Hiddensee in Pomerania, Germany, is one of the most important nesting grounds for cranes in the world.

 The AN/PSQ-42 Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular combines two image intensification tubes with an uncooled thermal imager and is able to operate in an I²-only mode or a fusion mode that combines I² with a thermal image overlay. The overlay is also capable of displaying a compass and augmented reality data from a Nett Warrior device. The ENVG-B can also display wirelessly transmitted weapon sight crosshair and thermal imagery from the Family of Weapon Sights-Individual (FWS-I) thermal imager mounted on a weapon. The image-intensifying tubes also allows the user to illuminate, designate, and engage targets conventionally with weapon-mounted infrared laser pointer-illuminator devices such as the AN/PEQ-15. The entire ENVG-B assembly consists of the ENVG-B goggles themselves, Positioning Assembly (PA), Helmet Mount Assembly (HMA) and battery pack. In a fashion similar to the AN/PSQ-20 and AN/PVS-31, the ENVG-B does not receive power from a battery within the goggle housing itself (such as in the AN/PVS-14). Instead, the goggle receives power from the battery pack mounted on the rear of the soldier's helmet via a circuit that traverses the HMA and PA, with hotshoe connectors at the interface between those components. This shifts the center mass of an ENVG-B equipped helmet toward the wearer's neck, resulting in a more ergonomic balance and reducing neck strain, especially in the prone. The ENVG-G assembly can be mounted on the ACH, ECH and IHPS helmets. A special helmet cover designed to conceal the battery pack and HMA exists for the ACH and ECH. A small infrared illuminator is built into the housing for viewing handheld items like a map, weapon, or radio. A gain control knob is centrally mounted on the bridge of the goggle housing. Both the eyepieces and objective lenses are capable of affixing a protective sacrificial lens, and the objective lenses have removable protective rubber caps with lanyards.	The AN/PSQ-42 Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular (ENVG-B) is the third generation of the AN/PVS-31 thermal imaging goggle.
 Chandramukhi was one of the esteemed courtesans of the kingdom of Vijayanagaram. Famous for her beauty as well as her singing and dancing skills, she becomes a royal court dancer. She was in love with Gunasekaran, a fellow court dancer who loved her equally and the pair performed together in court at times. Chandramukhi leads a normal life before Vettaiyan kills her and Gunasekaran. In her spirit form she becomes a force of blind rage and grief with hostile intentions. However she appears to be patient in her goal and possesses Ganga like a parasite, slowly transferring her personality into the host. Throughout it, her host will merge behaviors with her and replicate how the spirit acted in her lifetime, for example, a trait of Chandramukhi was excessive vanity and obsession with how beautiful she looked. In her fully possessed form, Chandramukhi is a compulsive dancer who enjoys listening to the sound of her voice. She also has a demonic and murderous personality when confronted with whom she believes to be Vettaiyan.	Chandramukhi was one of the esteemed courtesans of the kingdom of Vijayanagaram .

It manages to be a thrilling throwback adventure, a meta-commentary, and the story of two damaged, incompatible creators all at once, and despite my initial misgivings, it's impossible to separate all of those stories out from each other"". Ian Keogh also lauded Goldtiger, calling it ""a very clever and stylish pastiche"", also noting how well the strips and purported production material complemented each other."

" Addressing feudalism would necessitate a distinct kind of association with England. Historically, the fidelity of the local lords played a pivotal role in the Channel Islands' choice to remain under the English monarch. Central to this intricate relationship is the practice and importance of fiefs, deeply ingrained in Norman tradition. In Normandy, and subsequently in the Channel Islands, fiefs were deemed of utmost significance, as eloquently described in the Coutume de Normandie (the legal customs of Normandy): ""Je ne sais pas quelles sont ces dignités qui peuvent être possédés sans fond ni glebe, et pour lesquelles on doit hommage et non relief, à la réserve de certaines sargenteries qui n'ont point de glebe. Ces fiefs en l'air sont fiefs impropres; proprie enim feudum in rebus soli constitit.""transl. ""I do not know what these dignities are that can be held without foundation or glebe, and for which homage is due and not relief, except for certain sargenteries that have no glebe. These floating fiefs are improper fiefs; for a proper fief rests on tangible assets."" The Coutume elucidates the divergence between Norman and English practices: ""(en Normandie) on n'en use pas comme en Angleterre, où les dignités des Ducs & Comtes ne sont pas attachées aux fiefs. Ce sont des dignités personnelles que le ROI donne à qui lui plaît, et tel s'appelle Duc & comte de Warwick, de Northumberland... mais même n'y a rien du tout.""transl. ""(In Normandy) they do not operate as they do in England, where the titles of Dukes & Counts aren't tethered to fiefs. These are personal titles bestowed by the KING at his discretion, and someone might be named Duke & Count of Warwick, Northumberland... yet they don't hold any tangible property."" This distinction rests upon the inherent value placed on possessing glebe (landed estates) in the Channel Islands. While firmly rooted in Norman traditions, it contrasts sharply with the English approach. The Channel Islands' feudal tradition is commonly recognized as one of the unique characteristics that distinguish the islands and grants them a special status. As C. Northcote Parkinson once remarked: ""Without its feudalism, Guernsey as a tourist resort would be little different from Bognor Regis."""

 The Fifth Circuit analyzed whether Bitcoin transaction records are protected by the Fourth Amendment. The court likened Bitcoin transactions to bank records, which are not protected by the Fourth Amendment under the third-party doctrine. This doctrine holds that a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties. The court ruled that Gratkowski voluntarily disclosed information about his Bitcoin transactions to third parties (i.e., all users globally of the Bitcoin network and Coinbase), and therefore he had no reasonable expectation of privacy in this information. Affirming the district court's denial of Gratkowski's motion to suppress the evidence, the court ruled that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in Bitcoin transaction records on the blockchain or held by a third-party exchange like Coinbase, thus such records are not protected by the Fourth Amendment. The case was decided by a panel consisting of Circuit Judges Carl E. Stewart, James L. Dennis, and Catharina Haynes, with Judge Haynes delivering the opinion of the court.

" The story was one of several Crisis stories to be rapidly repackaged as a graphic novel, an unusual step for British comics of the time. Rian Hughes, art director for Crisis, handled the design, which included a new cover commissioned from Pleece and a foreword by Grant Morrison. At this stage the story began attracting negative attention from Christian groups, and The Sunday Times ran an interview with Dave Roberts (then-editor of Christian magazine Alpha), describing it as ""an incitement to religious hatred"" and comparing it to Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses as an example of blasphemy. Fleetway's managing director John Davidge, who had controversially blocked Crisis from publishing Peter Milligan and Brendan McCarthy's ""Skin"", ordered the collected edition withdrawn after a short period on sale; a press release stated this was due to the story being ""inappropriate"" for the book market. Purportedly Davidge made the decision on the direct order of Fleetway owner Robert Maxwell. The print run - variously reported as being 5,000 or 20,000 copies - was destroyed. The Economist ran an article on the controversy on 19 January 1991, speculating that ""no one would think twice about it"" if the story was a novel, and felt that the furore was largely caused by the ongoing belief in the press that the comic medium was still exclusively aimed at children. New Statesman also discussed the controversy, quoting a BBC Radio 4 interview where Ennis reiterated his opposition to organised religion. In 1997 DC's mature readers Vertigo Comics label, for whom Ennis was writing Preacher at the time, released a new collected edition with a fresh cover by Pleece and a ne foreword by Ennis himself."	The controversial Crisis story, which was published in 1991 by publisher Fleetway, has gone on display for the first time.
 Players of John Company will consider some of the issues that affected the historical EIC between 1710 and the 1860s. For instance, players must decide whether or not to try and conquer the Indian kingdoms; if they do, they may install a Governor-General, and traffic the opium they control to China. Players may hire Indians to assist them; these include Sikhs, the Jagat Seth family, Awadh, Arcot, Orissa, the Nizam of Hyderabad, and a Rajput prince. Meanwhile, Indians may revolt against the Company; in the real world, this led to the EIC's downfall, due to the Indian Revolt of 1857. The exact setup rules depend on the scenario the players choose, reflecting the historical fortunes of India and the EIC. For the 1710 or long 1710 scenarios, the Company has no debt, weak armies, and no ships. If the game starts in 1758, the Calico Acts will already have been passed, there is a governor in Bengal, the Company is already in debt, and Mysore and Bombay are stronger than in 1710. For an 1813 scenario, the Company has larger armies and more ships, while Bombay is weaker but the Punjab stronger. The laws players consider voting on also reflect historical fact. One card in the deck represents the Calico Acts; historically, these banned imports of cotton (as the EIC had been doing) and helped the rise and industrialization of the British cotton industry. If passed, the game card simulates this by reducing Company profits and allowing players to buy extra workshops while rewarding those who already have them; it also has support in Parliament, which reflects how MPs represented local economies dependent on textiles, while the rents of many Lords were connected to the wool industry. The Writer Privileges law, on the other hand, has less support in Parliament, but allows the players to gain extra money from trading in India, and makes future votes to deregulate the Company easier; a historical note on the card explains that reducing restrictions led to cheaper prices for Indian goods in Britain, which led to more support for deregulation. Players may also debate whether to recruit sepoys (Indian soldiers), extend the franchise (reducing the value of rotten boroughs and making it more expensive to buy votes), or provide relief for famines in India. These reflect issues Britain and the EIC faced in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the Reform Act 1832, Chartism, and several famines which affected India. One of the game's topics is the relationship between the EIC's actions in India and British culture then and now, and how reliant Britain was on its empire. For example, if the Company is successful, players will have more money and votes with which to influence Parliament; but whether it is or not, its violent actions will inevitably affect on its own culture.	A new board game based on the British East India Company's (EIC) activities in India has been released, and it is based on historical fact.
 Belarusian Hajun was created in early January 2022 as a monitoring initiative to track movements of Russian military equipment and troops on the territory of Belarus. The project had the task of monitoring the amount of equipment transported into the country and withdrawn, and where a new Russian military base could potentially emerge. The project was created so that Belarusians would understand what was happening on the territory of Belarus. On February 20, 2022, the Telegram channel of Hajun was created, in which the team began publishing information about detected Russian troops and their movements. For the first two months of the war, the team had to work 24/7. In February and March, an average of 1500 people a day wrote to the project. At the peak, this figure reached up to 2000 people. In March 2022, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus recognized the project's Telegram channel as an extremist formation. In April 2022, more than 360 thousand people subscribed to the channel. At that time, 90% were subscribers from Ukraine, and the rest were Belarusians. As of February 25, 2023, more than half a million people were subscribed to the project's Telegram channel.

 Of the monetary units that are included in the ISO 4217 standard and exist in cash, only the Panamanian balboa is not issued in the form of banknotes - the local population in Panama uses balboa coins and US dollar banknotes. Also, in real money circulation, there are some other monetary units only in the form of coins. This is due to the spread of a parallel currency in the relevant territory: Tuvaluan dollar and Kiribati dollar - Australian dollar banknotes are used; Pitcairn Islands dollar - banknotes of the New Zealand dollar are used; Timorese and Ecuadorian centavo - US dollar banknotes are used; in Madagascar, coins of the Malagasy franc remain in circulation, while banknotes and coins of the Malagasy ariary are mainly used.

" Since the establishment of the standard, the policy for compiling dictionaries has been to publish character books that are based on the assumption that all JIS basic Kanji characters are listed. However, for ghost characters included in JIS Basic Kanji, it is not possible to refer to past sources. Therefore, their treatment differed depending on the dictionaries and individual characters as follows. Assign readings for convenienceIn information equipment that implements JIS basic Kanji characters, it is not good enough that even ghost characters do not appear when converted as long as they are implemented. Therefore, they are often assigned a ""phonetic reading,"" which is interpreted as a form of phonetic writing for convenience. Some dictionaries also list these convenient readings. Hiroyuki Sasahara points out that these readings may have been given based on a research report by the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (1982) and published materials by NEC (1982) and IBM Japan (1983). Regarded as Glyph with similar charactersSome have assigned ""駲"" as a variant of ""馴"" and ""軅"" as a variant of ""軈"". However, none of these sources provide a source. The character ""妛"" is a variant of the very similar character ""妛"" (the upper ""山"" becomes ""屮"") found in the Dai Kan-Wa Jiten and Kangxi Dictionary. This is also introduced in the JIS X 0208:1997 survey with an example of implicit merging with an authoritative source. These two characters are also merged into the same code point in Unicode. Own interpretationSince ""竜"" is a variant of ""龍"", there is an interpretation that ""槞"" is a variant of ""櫳"". Some dictionaries consider ""鵈""=""耳(ear)""+""鳥(bird)"" to be the national character for Black kite a bird with a distinctive cry that lives abundantly in Japan. These are also introduced with authority in the JIS X 0208:1997 survey. Explain as unknownDescribe as is that the reading or significance is unknown. After the results of the aforementioned research were known, the contents of these are generally adopted in dictionaries. The Dai Kan-Wa Jiten published a supplemental volume in 2000, and the Kadokawa Shin Jigen (New Character Source) published a revised new edition in 2017, both of which include some of the characters whose sources have been identified."	The JIS X 0208:1997 survey was the first major survey of the JIS basic Kanji characters, but it did not include all the characters that are now included in JIS Basic Kanji.

" Boskovich (1956–2006) studied at the California Institute of the Arts under the tutelage of conceptual artist John Baldessari. His work has been cited as drawing heavily from Dadaism, and frequently utilised objects, photography, handwritten and typeset texts and audio sources to create ""witty and sharp-edged social commentary"". Boskovich was in a relationship with Stephen Earabino, a fashion stylist originally from Massachusetts, with whom he lived in an apartment in Los Angeles, California. In 1995, Earabino died from AIDS-related complications. Shortly after his death, Earabino's family emptied out the flat Earabino shared with Boskovich, removing all of his items, as well as most of Boskovich's, with the only remaining item being an electric box fan."

 In 1980, a foreign activist cut nets to release 250 to 300 dolphins caught in fishing on Iki Island. : 80–81 Peter Singer, a researcher in ethical philosophy, came to Japan from Australia to defend. A Japanese district court sentenced the activist to six months in prison, suspended for three years. In December 1980, a joint operation between Futo and Kawana was being conducted in Futo, when a small whale escaped by foreign activists. 。 Demand for dolphins increased as a substitute for whales around the time of the commercial whaling moratorium. The number of porpoises captured increased from 16,515 in 1986 to 40,367 in 1988. As a result, catch limits were established for each fishing method and for each dolphin species, beginning with the 1991 porpoises.	Japan's dolphin crisis has led to a dramatic increase in the number of porpoises captured by foreign activists.
 The model of the Chinese Mongolian is the same as that of the Mongolian horse. It is considered locally as a horse because of this model and not as a pony. The head has a rectilinear profile and is rather heavy, with a broad forehead, open nostrils, protruding eyes, and long ears. The neck is short and muscular, the chest deep, the shoulder fairly sloping and muscular. The withers are not very prominent; the back is short, solid, and straight. The croup is long and sloping. The legs are short, strong, and solid. The breed is renowned for its solid constitution. The average height is 1.28 m, 1.27 m for mares, and 1.30 m for males. Weight ranges from 300 to 360 kg, with an average of 360 for males and 300 for females. There are variations according to type. For example, the University of Oklahoma study, dating from 2007, gives a size range from 1.21 to 1.42 m, and CAB International, in its study published in 2016, 1.22 to 1.42 m. Size increases markedly when environmental conditions are favorable.	The Chinese Mongolian horse is one of the world's most famous breeds, according to the British Academy of Sciences.
 He attended the Ohio State University, where he majored in journalism. In 1956 as a member of the senior men’s Sphinx honorary society, he helped lead an effort for Ohio State alumnus Jesse Owens to be initiated into Sphinx. Bailey also interviewed Owens and wrote about him for the Ohio State University Lantern. Bailey was editor of the Ohio State University Lantern his senior year and, on April 30, 1956, wrote a front-page editorial headlined, “Yes, we are Guilty,” which bluntly called for college football players to be paid. “Pay the players,” he wrote. “Only the blind cling to the myth that it is still…amateurism... Cast aside the mask of hypocrisy.”	Neil Bailey, the editor of a newspaper which called for college football players to be paid, has died at the age of 87.

" Some time in the late 1990s or early 2000s, Johnny Science chose to go ""stealth"" - that is, to pull away from FTM activism and blend in with the cisgender gay male community. His friends regularly told him of the goings-on in the trans community, and he expressed sadness over feeling like he could not both participate and be accepted as a man by wider society. Science found a new home in gay kink communities, becoming both a member of the Gay Male S&M Activists and the Metro NY Chapter president of the National Leather Association. In the mid-1990s, Science founded The Jovian Gentlemen, a social club for older men and younger men who wanted to date each other. Many events hosted by The Jovian Gentlemen were kinky play parties. Science preserved hundreds of documents, videos, sound files, and other ephemera pertaining to his and other peoples' LGBT activism in both print and digital form in his home.Johnny Science was in ill health for the last ten years of his life. He died of heart failure in 2007 and was given an extensive obituary in issue #114 of Transgender Tapestry. The ephemera he preserved were donated to New York University after he died. In 2019, some ephemera collected by Johnny Science was displayed at NYU's Bobst Library in an exhibition entitled ""Violet Holdings: LGBTQ+ Highlights from the NYU Special Collections."""

" Angela of Metal.de compared 10 Year Anniversary: Live in Reykjavík to Skáldöld's previous live album, Skálmöld & Sinfóníuhljómsveit Íslands (2013), which was recorded with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra, and said the new album displays the band ""at its purest"". She said it reflects the experience of Skálmöld's regular concerts, with the audience singing along in Icelandic throughout the songs, a unique feature of shows in the band's home country. She said the setlist is a good selection from the band's five studio albums and should satisfy both old and new listeners, only missing the track ""Loki"" which otherwise often is part of the live sets. Carl Fisher of Games, Brrraaains & A Head-Banging Life wrote that the quality of the audio production sometimes makes it sound like a studio album, while at the same time, the audience can be heard clearly.

 Dūr-Abī-ešuḫ is attested to have been occupied during the reigns of four contiguous rulers of Babylon, Abi-Eshuh, Ammi-Ditana, Ammi-Saduqa and Samsu-Ditana. This period marked the slow decline of the Old Babylonian Empire from the glory days of Hammurabi and the early rise of the First Sealand Dynasty beginning under its first ruler Ilī-ma-AN. Under ruler Samsu-iluna, predecessor of Abi-Eshuh, Babylon lost effective control over Nippur to Ilī-ma-AN and Sealand. Abi-Eshuh fortified the southern region of the Babylonian empire and dammed the Tigris river and as a result full control of Nippur had been regained by his 5th year. It is known that on or about year 11 of the reign of Ammi-Ditana, successor in Babylon to Abi-Eshuh, the major city of Nippur came under attack and was again partially abandoned. Dūr-Abī-ešuḫ was pivotal in the defense of Nippur.	The ancient city of Dūr-Abī-ešuḫ was the capital of the Old Babylonian Empire from the time of Hammurabi to the end of the First Sealand Dynasty.

" Typically a skimmer draws water from the pool through a rectangular opening in the wall, at the top of the pool, connected through a device installed in one (or more) walls of the pool. The internal parts of the skimmer are accessed from the pool deck through a circular or rectangular cover, approximately one foot in diameter. If the pool's water pump is operational, it draws water from the pool through a hinged floating chute (which operates from a vertical position at a 90-degree angle to the pool, to prevent leaves and debris from being washed back into the pool by wave action), and down into a removable ""skimmer basket"", whose purpose is to catch leaves, dead insects and other larger floating debris. The opening visible from the side of the pool is usually 1'0"" (300 mm) wide by 6"" (150 mm) high, which cuts the water halfway down the center of the opening. Skimmers with wider openings are called ""wide angle"" skimmers and can be up to 2'0"" wide (600 mm). Floating skimmers have the advantage of not being affected by water level, as they adjust to work with the suction rate of the pump and will maintain optimal skimming regardless of water level, leading to a significantly reduced amount of biomaterial in the water. Skimmers should always have a leaf basket or filter between it and the pump to avoid clogging the pipes leading to the pump and filter."

" In traditional Chinese medicine, several medicinal teas incorporate cash coins as ingredients. This usage of cash coins has been documented as early as the Eastern Jin dynasty, in China's first emergency medicine manual, Zhou hou fang (肘後方).Brass cash coins would first be thoroughly washed before their usage in this process and then boiled in water to produce a type of ""tea"" which was later consumed by the patient. Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine believe that the zinc present in cash coins, which had been leached into the slightly acidic liquid, are said to supposedly promote both healing and the enhancement of the immune system. Meanwhile, bronze cash coins which typically have high concentrations of lead and tin (which in traditional Chinese medicine are said to have the same ""medicinal properties"" as the element mercury), were typically boiled to produce a solution used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of the auris externa. Vietnamese cash coins, which have the highest levels of zinc of any cash coins, were ground up into a powder that was mixed into an aqueous solution or a type of ointment for the treatment of the eyes, ears, and hemorrhoids, or for more topical uses."

 The AN/PSQ-42 Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular combines two image intensification tubes with an uncooled thermal imager and is able to operate in an I²-only mode or a fusion mode that combines I² with a thermal image overlay. The overlay is also capable of displaying a compass and augmented reality data from a Nett Warrior device. The ENVG-B can also display wirelessly transmitted weapon sight crosshair and thermal imagery from the Family of Weapon Sights-Individual (FWS-I) thermal imager mounted on a weapon. The image-intensifying tubes also allows the user to illuminate, designate, and engage targets conventionally with weapon-mounted infrared laser pointer-illuminator devices such as the AN/PEQ-15. The entire ENVG-B assembly consists of the ENVG-B goggles themselves, Positioning Assembly (PA), Helmet Mount Assembly (HMA) and battery pack. In a fashion similar to the AN/PSQ-20 and AN/PVS-31, the ENVG-B does not receive power from a battery within the goggle housing itself (such as in the AN/PVS-14). Instead, the goggle receives power from the battery pack mounted on the rear of the soldier's helmet via a circuit that traverses the HMA and PA, with hotshoe connectors at the interface between those components. This shifts the center mass of an ENVG-B equipped helmet toward the wearer's neck, resulting in a more ergonomic balance and reducing neck strain, especially in the prone. The ENVG-G assembly can be mounted on the ACH, ECH and IHPS helmets. A special helmet cover designed to conceal the battery pack and HMA exists for the ACH and ECH. A small infrared illuminator is built into the housing for viewing handheld items like a map, weapon, or radio. A gain control knob is centrally mounted on the bridge of the goggle housing. Both the eyepieces and objective lenses are capable of affixing a protective sacrificial lens, and the objective lenses have removable protective rubber caps with lanyards.

 The slogan of The Farmlink Project is “Fighting food insecurity is our mission - repurposing surplus produce is our solution.”. According to the website, “The Farmlink Project is acting as the “link” connecting the broken supply chains in the agricultural and access industries.”. The Washington Post reported in 2020 that The Farmlink Project “raises money to pay farmers for produce and dairy that would otherwise be wasted, then funds the transportation to send the goods to food banks in the neediest areas around the country.”. The Farmlink Project's website states that it will cover all shipping and logistics costs, organize and oversee all transportation and delivery logistics, work with all quantities, packaging, and produce of any form, and optimize and file for maximum possible value of tax benefits for farmers. In an interview with the Boston Globe, one of the original creators of the project explained that The Farmlink Project is founded and built by “more than 200 college students from about 30 colleges - including Stanford University, Cornell University, and Georgetown University - and other walks of life.”	The “link” connects the broken supply chains in the agricultural and access industries.
 Informateur Wim van der Grinten explored the possibility of bringing together PvdA, CDA and D'66 without success. The former KVP state secretary was appointed on the recommendation of Van Agt to 'investigate the possibilities of forming a cabinet in the shortest possible time that can be confident of receiving sufficient support from the parliament'. Van der Grinten tried to force a breakthrough with various compromises, but together with the negotiators he concluded that the 'implementation problem' was unsolvable. Van der Grinten then investigated whether PvdA wanted to work with VVD, but Van Thijn rejected this. The discussions between CDA and VVD subsequently led to an agreement within a week. The conversations between Van Agt and Wiegel started on 14 November. On Wiegel's recommendation, they decided to strive to keep it short and concise. Wiegel's proposal to keep the outside world - including their factions - out was also adopted. Even council advisor Herman Tjeenk Willink and director of the Government Information Service Gijs van der Wiel, who had always been there until then, were sent away. Already in the first conversation they managed to make agreements about the WIR, the VAD, the works councils and the distribution of ministerial posts. Parts of the agreement with PvdA and D'66 were adopted, such as the abortion paragraph. What helped was the good atmosphere between the party leaders, in contrast to the conversations between Van Agt with Van Thijn and Den Uyl. The draft agreement was sent to the factions on 22 November. The VVD quickly agreed, but under pressure from ARP members such as Aantjes and Scholten, dozens of amendments were submitted. Wiegel responded with understanding and an amended agreement was reached on 26 November. The VVD faction unanimously agreed to the result on 28 November. An extensive consultation took place at the CDA, which continued until the early morning. The majority voted in favor, but six faction members — Aantjes, Hans de Boer, Beumer, Van Houwelingen, Scholten (all from ARP) and Dijkman (KVP) — voted against. They indicated that they tolerated the cabinet and were known as the CDA loyalists. During a faction meeting on 5 December Willem de Kwaadsteniet also joined this group. Because of this tolerating support, there was some commotion, because Van der Grinten's assignment was to create a parliamentary majority cabinet. PvdA objected to this, but this had no effect. On 2 December the parties reached an agreement in principle on the distribution of ministerial posts. Van Agt was the intended prime minister, after Jelle Zijlstra, Pierre Lardinois, Jan van den Brink and Roelof Nelissen had resigned.

 On January 13, 1765, Van Eck, accompanied by Koopman and other officers, embarked on a journey from Colombo to rendezvous with an army stationed at Gonavila. Their route took them through Negombo and Tambaravila. Subsequent intelligence revealed that the Kandyans were bolstering their forces and fortifications, actively preparing for a potential invasion. Despite numerous challenges including widespread illnesses and frequent skirmishes, the Dutch army managed to persevere and eventually reached Kandy. Their journey led them through various locations, including Katugampola, Etambole, Visnave, Pidaravala, Kurunegala, Teliangona, and Vauda. Their final destination was the heavily fortified Galagedra fortress, which posed significant challenges to overcome. Nevertheless, after a day of concerted efforts, the fortress was successfully captured. The main army successfully crossed the Hoenay Oya on the morning of February 16. Upon reaching Katugastota along the banks of the Mahaweli River, they encountered another colonel who had already established a camp in the vicinity. Occupying the king's pleasure residence, they proceeded to plunder it. Subsequently, on February 19, they crossed the river. Arriving at the king's palace, they observed the king's absence. This led them to remain there for three days, during which they engaged in looting and plundering. Notably, substantial Kandyan forces emerged, bearing white flags as a sign of submission to the company. This event unfolded on February 22, and Van Eck, in response, conducted promotions for army officers and generals. The invasion proceeded with notable success, characterized by a lack of setbacks. Swiftly advancing and overcoming every Kandyan army they encountered, they demonstrated remarkable progress. In a parallel effort, another contingent led by Colonel Wesel, numbering 700 men, set out to dismantle the king's alternate palace. Upon receiving information that the king was residing there. Upon reaching the palace, it became evident that the king had fled again, the soldiers plundered and looted it again. As this group returned, they fell victim to an ambush, resulting in the unfortunate death of 48 soldiers on March 4. On the same day, Van Eck, along with fellow officers, journeyed back to Colombo. During their absence, Colonel Feber assumed responsibility for overseeing the occupation. Van Eck's return was met with a warm welcome and congratulations for the successful campaign. However, news soon arrived that the Kandyans had adopted guerrilla warfare tactics, launching an attack on a transport and a farm. Colonel Feber, who was in charge of the occupation, sought additional reinforcements in response to sporadic guerrilla warfare activities. Subsequently, following a significant engagement between Dutch forces and Kandyan insurgents on March 24th, reinforcements successfully entered occupied Kandy. During a battle while marching to Feber, Major Franken's troops emerged victorious against the Kandyan forces, compelling them to retreat to higher terrain. After a period of illness within the Dutch ranks and subsequent skirmishes with the Kandyan adversaries, diplomatic negotiations eventually led to the establishment of a peace agreement.	A series of events leading to the preparation of an army for a potential invasion.
 The principle of the ethological halter seems to have been discovered by American Horse Whisperer Tom Dorrance. The American veterinarian Robert M. Miller believes that its use in the USA stems from the bosal hackamore of the Vaqueros, which has been adopted by almost all practitioners of natural horsemanship in the form of a rope halter with knots. According to Cynthia McFarland, American cowboys were the first to discover and make a rope halter. The use of this equipment spread from the United States to France in the early 2000s, as well as to Germany, accompanying the development of ethological equitation. French rider Michel Robert is a pioneer in the world of show jumping. Equestrian equipment manufacturers have adapted to demand. Many now offer this type of halter for sale, with a wide choice of models, colors and materials, and knots that can be placed in different ways. In the United States, the marketing of an ethological halter supposed to make horses softer, under the name of be-nice, has sparked debate.	American veterinarian Robert M.

 Nigeria received an RFI emergency loan for economic losses incurred due to COVID-19, which is to be repaid within 5 years, and repayments beginning within the third year. The RFI loan was conditioned upon the nation's adherence to transparency and participation in independent audits of crisis-mitigation. Moreover, Nigeria agreed to publish emergency expenses to ensure the loan was being utilized for its specified purpose. There was a severe drop in international demand and oil prices by 2020, resulting in exports decline of more than US$26 billion.In June 2022, under the leadership of IMF's Mission Chief in Nigeria, Jesmin Rahman, convened several meetings assessing the present condition of the Nigerian economy following COVID-19, the 2020 RFI loan, and the repercussions of the Russia-Ukraine war.

" The renovations made by Robertson Ward from 1934 to 1935 converted both structures from an Italianate design to the Regency Revival style and also architecturally harmonized the two buildings. Ward added a loggia with columns and wall details including blind arches and paired pilasters supporting a frieze, cornice and pediment to the forecourt, which was separated from the street by a unique iron fence decorated with anchors and drafting tools that extended in front of No. 150. Lanterns on the sides of the front gate to the forecourt depict ""150"" and ""152"" to represent the house numbers of the complex. The front doorway to No. 152 is raised four steps from the ground and has glass side lights with delicate pilasters supporting a molded entablature and a transom; iron trellises were used in lieu of columns to support a scalloped bronze canopy covering the stoop. The front façade of the house has double-hung sash windows with black shutters and includes a frieze and a cornice crowned by a brick parapet. A formal garden was located behind No. 150, which contained a patch of grass edged with boxwood and was surrounded by pathways, shrubs and trees."

 The result was Selangor's biggest league victory in 87 years. Kelantan has now broken the Malaysian football record with recorded 106 goals conceded in all competitions this season including a record breaking 87 goals conceded in the Super League. On previous results they also lost with a big score to Terengganu with a result of 8–0 in the league match and also Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT) with a result of 10–0 in the cup match. Kelantan head coach Angel Alfredo Vera said that the lack of imported players in his squad was one of the reasons for the team’s crushing big loss defeat to Selangor in their Super League match. He shrugged off the result saying, “We didn’t have players who could dominate this match, especially imported players. The players we have are very young, they don’t have the experience, on average they have only played five Super League matches,” he told the post-match press conference. The outcome was also the worst loss by a home team in Malaysian football history, as the eleventh-goal difference doubled the previous record margin. == References ==	Malaysian football team Kelantan suffered a record-breaking 10-goal defeat to Selangor in their Super League match on Saturday.
 After the period of Arab rule in Armenia and the South Caucasus, a new period of cultural flourishing began, and active church building was accompanied by new sculptural compositions and solutions. The “first signs” were khachkars (crossstones), which partially continued the tradition of four-sided stelae, forming an original compositional and iconographic system. The period of great and small kingdoms in Armenia, the 9th-11th centuries, was characterized by the formation of several large cultural centers and artistic styles: in Shirak (Shirakavan, Argina, Kars, Ani), Tayk (Ishkhan, Banak, Chordvan, Khakhu), Vaspurakan (Aghtamar), Syunik (Tatev, Bgheno-Noravank). In 915-921 by the order of Gagik Artsruni, the Armenian king of Vaspurakan, one of the unique Armenian monuments, the Church of the Holy Cross on the Aghtamar island was built. The peculiarity of the building was the modest size of the church, the facades of which the architect Manuel managed to decorate with an unprecedented number of sculptures and extensive scenes. The animal types in reliefs are also unprecedented, including fabulous ones. Alternating each other uninterrupted rows of scenes and images of the Aghtamar church seem to be the visual embodiments of the Holy Bible. The monumental images of King Gagik and the deified ancestors of the Artsruni family also found their place in this “Heavenly World”. The 9th-11th centuries Armenian sculpture is rich in images of patrons. On the tympanum of the main entrance of the church of Yerznka (near Ani) (895) were depicted two princes on horseback before the Virgin and Child and accompanied by angels (destroid). In the second half of the 10th century, the high relief figures of the crowned princes Gurgen and Smbat Bagratuni were depicted on the eastern facades of the main churches of Sanahin and Haghpat monasteries (St. Amenaprkich church 966, St. Nshan church 976). And the representatives of the younger branch of Bagratuni (in Tayk), Bagrat and David, were solemnly depicted in Oshkvank (963-973). The compositions of Aghtamar and Oshkvank had direct iconographic correlation to Byzantine imperial images (the mosaic of Constantine and Justinian, St. Sophia, end of the 10th century). And the almost round sculpture of Smbat Bagratuni in Haghpat got its further development in the two-meter statue of King Gagik of Ani, which once decorated the façade of the church of St. Grigor- Gagkashen (1001-1020, architect Trdat). A group of frontal sculptural faces are pre-their unique decorations. That composition consisted of blind arcades extending along the facades of the church and a sculptured “belt” of the Heavenly Garden inhabited by birds, animals, and sometimes with human figures.	This invention relates to the field of sculpture, and in particular to the field of sculpture and church facades.
" It was established on 4 July 2022, with the purpose of expressing opposition to the French presence in Operation Barkhane, which the group perceives as a ""French military presence in Niger""; the group views it as a form of invasion. During these protests, participants used the flags of Russia and Niger as symbols. Protests continued as of 19 September 2022, and certain slogans emerged, such as ""France is a Nazi State! "", ""The colonial army (Barkhane) must leave"", and ""Pull the French colonial army out"". Many protesters also wore shirts depicting the Z symbol used during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The leader of M62, Abdoulaye Seydou, has denied any links with the Russian government, stating that ""We are fighting for Niger's sovereignty, so we are not with any foreign country partners"", and said protest organizers confiscated Russian flags brought by protesters. In an interview with The Irish Times, he described Thomas Sankara as an ""idol"" for his opposition to neocolonialism. Seydou was arrested by the government of Mohamed Bazoum just one day after the interview. During the 2023 Nigerien coup d'état against Bazoum, the group marched in support of the coup. In a march at the request of Abdourahmane Tchiani, thousands of pro-coup Nigeriens gathered in Niamey's Concertation Square, in front of the National Assembly, and went to the French embassy carrying Nigerien and Russian flags, with slogans such as ""Down with France, out with Barkhane, we don't care about ECOWAS, the European Union and the African Union! "", ""Arrest the former dignitaries to return the stolen millions"", and ""Down with France, long live Putin!"" The demonstrators also called for an immediate intervention by the Russian paramilitary Wagner Group. During the march, the entrances to the French and American embassies were closed. The French embassy's walls and gates were set ablaze and damaged whilst Nigerien soldiers and General Salifou Modi were seen on the ground urging the crowds to disperse peacefully. == References =="	In opposition to the presence inhane, which the group perceives as a military presence, which the group views it as a form of invasion.

 Pieces tend to be large, with multi-coloured fills and outlines. They often incorporate highlights and a background, and may use extensions, 3D effects, and sometimes characters. Because of their complexity and large size, pieces usually take a significant amount of time to plan and paint and therefore are often found on legal walls. Illegal pieces tend to be found in less crowded spaces such as train yards, tunnels, drains, rooftops, and walls facing train tracks. Illegal pieces done in busier areas are often done over multiple nights or by mutiple members of a crew. Many people unfamiliar with graffiti forms can find it difficult to distinguish the letters in more elaborate pieces. While straight-letters are pieces with clear letters that prioritise legibility, wildstyle pieces have extremely exaggerated letters forms with multiple extensions and add-ons, and are often illegible to many people. This may be a deliberate choice to allow only those familiar with the art form to read them. Some writers choose to sign their pieces with personal and crews.

" The Ius in Memoria are akin to Ius in Bello, in focusing more on the ""how"" of commemoration. It has four criteria: Transcend the Collectives. Commemoration is seen as ethical if it encourages people to treat each other as individuals rather than group representatives. Exit Circular Narratives. Commemoration should help people exit narratives that trap them in debilitating interpretative loops. Assert Moral Autonomy. Groups should justify their actions in universal terms, rather than excusing transgressions with reference to what others have done. Contained Unfathomability. Good commemoration should be precise with dates, locations and names to tether past trauma. Numerical aspects of trauma should typically be communicated in broad categories. Proponents of the approach argue that taken together, the framework can constitute a comprehensive ethical approach or paradigm for commemoration. They concede that critiques of the just war tradition also apply to this moral framework, in that both pacifist and realist/revolutionary alternatives retain their validity."

" Since the establishment of the standard, the policy for compiling dictionaries has been to publish character books that are based on the assumption that all JIS basic Kanji characters are listed. However, for ghost characters included in JIS Basic Kanji, it is not possible to refer to past sources. Therefore, their treatment differed depending on the dictionaries and individual characters as follows. Assign readings for convenienceIn information equipment that implements JIS basic Kanji characters, it is not good enough that even ghost characters do not appear when converted as long as they are implemented. Therefore, they are often assigned a ""phonetic reading,"" which is interpreted as a form of phonetic writing for convenience. Some dictionaries also list these convenient readings. Hiroyuki Sasahara points out that these readings may have been given based on a research report by the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (1982) and published materials by NEC (1982) and IBM Japan (1983).

 The period before menstruation, known as the premenstrual phase, is often linked to emotional distress. Conditions related to the menstrual cycle encompass premenstrual tension syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and the exacerbation of another medical condition during the premenstrual phase. Menstruation is linked to a range of psychopathological symptoms, such as lower self-esteem, increased anxiety, dysphoria, and feelings of being persecuted. Changes in behavior, like decreased social interaction during menstruation, can lead to feelings of loneliness and potentially contribute to the development of depression. Several reviews have reported that psychopathological symptoms and mental disorders, such as psychoses, suicidal tendencies, post-traumatic stress disorder, and addictive behaviors, tend to worsen during menstruation. Variations in ovarian hormone levels are also linked to the presence of symptoms related to eating disorders. Some comprehensive studies have indicated that women might be at a higher risk of suicide during menstruation. The symptoms occurring during menstruation can have a significant impact on mental health and lead to severe consequences.	Menstruation is one of the most common periods of the year for women in the United States, and it can have a significant impact on mental health.
" People have willingly arranged to be buried alive, reportedly demonstrating their disputed ability to survive such an event for many centuries. The fear of being buried alive peaked during the cholera epidemics of the 19th century, but accounts of unintentional live burial have been recorded even earlier. Reports of doctors and accounts in literature heightened these fears. The subject is detailed in ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" and ""The Cask of Amontillado"", Edgar Allan Poe wrote ""The Premature Burial"", which was published in 1844. It contained accounts of supposedly genuine cases of premature burial and detailing the narrator's (perceived) interment while still alive. In 1822, German Dr. Adolf Gutsmuth was buried alive several times to demonstrate a safety coffin of his design, staying underground for several hours and eating a meal of soup, bratwurst, marzipan, sauerkraut, spätzle, beer, and for dessert, prinzregententorte, delivered to him through the coffin's feeding tube. In 1840, Sadhu Haridas, an Indian yogi, is said to have been buried for ten months. The yogi said that his only fear during his ""wonderful sleep"" was being eaten by underground worms. However, according to current medical science, a human can't survive for ten months without food, water, and air. According to other sources the entire burial was 40 days long. The Indian government has since made voluntary premature burial illegal because of the unintended deaths of individuals attempting to recreate this feat. In 1898, Russian Count Michel de Karnice-Karnicki invented a safety coffin called ""Le Karnice"". A long tube measuring 8.89 cm (3.5 in) in diameter was connected with an aperture in the coffin, with the other end emerging above ground (rather like the periscope of a submarine). Italian Faroppo Lorenzo consented to be buried in ""Le Karnice"". On 17 December 1898, he was buried and emerged on the 26th of December. Signor Lorenzo’s only comment, when dug up after this dismal underground Christmas vacation, was that it had been ""damned smelly down there""."	The fear of being buried alive peaked during the cholera epidemics of the 19th century. Reports of unintentional live burial have been recorded even earlier. The Indian government has since made voluntary premature burial illegal.
 In 1878, the Oviedo City Council received an application for permission to build the mining railway on Monte Naranco, which raised concerns as it was feared that the construction of the railway would affect the water supply of Fitoria, as it ran parallel to that of the future railway line. On 1 February 1880, the original 7,101-metre (7,766 yd) long mining railway between the Villapérez area and the northern station of Oviedo operated by the Compañía de los Ferrocarriles de Asturias, Galicia y León was inaugurated with an original length of 7.1 km (4.4 mi). The total cost of building the railway was 129,906 pesetas, including 19,798 pesetas for expropriations.	The history of the Oviedo mining railway can be traced back to a dispute between the city council and the inhabitants of the nearby village of Fitoria.
 It is said that the idol was sculpted by the Vishwakarma Brahmins on the order of Maharishi Bharadvaja and the idol was consecrated by Bharadvaja and worshiped by his descendants. The temple is later built by Athiyamān Nedumān Añci the king of Dharmapuri and later renovated by Tirumala Nayaka. The temple has beautifully carved Mandapas. The temple has 2 Mandapams out of those the Artha Mandapam has 27 beautiful sculptured pillars. Out of the 28 pillars, there are 12 pillars which are sculpted in a manner which can produce musical notes when struck. Tamil poet says that the pillars here are a combination of the Shruti Gana Laya types. The Mandapam has beautiful architectural representations of various forms of Vishnu and few scenes of Ramayana, Mahabharatha and Srimad Bhagavatham. There are separate shrines for Sudarshana Perumal, Alvars, Hanuman, Garuda and Andal.	It is said that the idol was sculpted by the Vishwakarma Brahmins on the order of Maharishi Bharadvaja .

" Clarke Garrison was portrayed from 1987 to 1992 and from 1996 to 2009 by Daniel McVicar. McVicar describes Clarke as ""the classic heel with a heart, a cad with a conscience"". He is a former fashion designer for the now-defunct Spectra Fashions. Originally a student at Otis Parsons Institute the eternally ambitious character has always wrestled with the balance between ambition and questions of the heart. He has two sons, C.J. (Mick Cain) from his marriage to Sally Spectra (played by Darlene Conley), and Mark (Michael Dietz) from his affair with Margo Lynley (Lauren Koslow). He was also once married to Kristen Forrester (then played by Teri Ann Linn). Their relationship began when Kristen's mother, Stephanie (Susan Flannery), hired Clarke to seduce Kristen, fearing that her daughter was frigid. Clarke began to have feelings for Kristen and they married, before splitting later. Clarke left town in September 1992, returning four years later to see his son, C.J. (then played by Kyle Sabihy). C.J. wanted nothing to do with his father, angry at Clarke for walking out on him and Sally. This changed when Clarke rescued him from kidnappers. Clarke and Sally remained close friends; she affectionately called him ""Bucky"". He also shared a bond with Sally's former receptionist, Darla (Schae Harrison), who Sally thought of as a daughter. After a disastrous flirtation with Morgan DeWitt (Sarah Buxton), which almost ended with Clarke being killed by her pet python, ""Patsy"", Clarke began to woo a recently returned Kristen (now Tracy Melchior). His attempts at seducing his ex-wife were unsuccessful, as Kristen moved on with Tony Dominguez (Paulo Benedeti). Clarke's most notable lapse in judgement was in early 2005, when he reluctantly helped a vengeful Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz) trap Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss) and his stepdaughter Bridget Forrester (Ashley Jones) down a mineshaft in the hope that they would give into their ""feelings"" for one another, destroying Ridge's marriage to Bridget's mother, Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang). Amber received the ammunition she needed, and she and Clarke escaped prosecution due to Sally's pleas for Stephanie not to press charges. It seems, however, that the Forresters have forgiven Clarke for this crime, as he is often present at their family gatherings. Until recently Clarke worked at Forrester Creations, as the new head designer, after being hired by the new owners at that time, Nick (Jack Wagner) and Jackie Marone (Lesley-Anne Down). He was demoted to designer after Brooke returned to Forrester Creations and was made head designer. After Eric Forrester (John McCook) bought back Forrester Creations, he was under no obligation to honor Clarke's contract and Clarke was released from the company. Not too long after Jackie Marone and Dominick Marone sold Forrester Creations back to the Forresters, Clarke found himself once again back at Spectra Fashions. Because the new owners of Spectra Fashions had gone bankrupt, the company was reverted to Sally Spectra. As she no longer wanted to run the business, Sally Spectra asked Clarke and their son C.J. to sell the business for her. Knowing Jackie and her son would be interested, Clarke made his way to their home. One thing led to the next and Nick purchased the company making Clarke their head designer. The company was later renamed ""M Fashions"". Clarke worked at Jackie M Designs, the company formerly known as Spectra Fashions."

" News of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces. The threat of mutiny was rife. Admiral Reinhard Scheer and Ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the ""valour"" of the German Navy. In northern Germany, the German Revolution of 1918–1919 began at the end of October 1918. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost, initiating the uprising. The sailors' revolt, which then ensued in the naval ports of Wilhelmshaven and Kiel, spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918, shortly thereafter to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and to German surrender."

 On January 30, 2012, the Osisko Mining Corporation announced that they would suspend exploration activities due to “community protests and media reports and requests.”In a press release, Osisko denied claims of a “mega-mining” project, and explained that the project is not a mining project, but an exploration project at this point. The press release stated: “If there is no social license for exploration and development around the Famatina project area, no work will be conducted.” Osisko also stressed their commitment to socially and environmentally sound exploration methods. They are planning a community consultation program and hope to reassure residents of Famatina about the potential environmental and economic impacts a mining project in their area could have. == References ==	Osisko Mining Corporation announced they would suspend exploration activities due to “community protests and media reports and requests” The company denied claims of a “mega-mining” project .

 Currently, the Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo forest is a large natural area and one of the largest recreational areas in the North West of Moscow along with Serebryany Bor. A linden park is on the north side of the manor house. Some very old trees have also been preserved there. The park has a variety of tree types, including pines, maples, larches, lindens, oaks, birchs, elms, cedars, spruces, and apple trees. Many local residents frequently visit the ponds located in the eastern part of the park. There is a beach area around a large pond, with some trees. The northern and northwestern parts of the park were created relatively recently where a mixed forest originally was. The layout has a system of paths. The northwestern natural boundary of the park is the Khimka River, the only clean source of drinking water in Moscow as of 2009. The spring has several water pipes, where residents of neighboring and remote areas can collect clean drinking water. The spring had a mosaic panel depicting a swan princess that was destroyed after updates were made to the spring.

 In 2006, a photo of an unidentified, large, monocarpic, fan palm in Madagascar was posted on PalmTalk, the society’s online forum. This photo led botanists to the site and to the discovery and description of a monotypic genus new to science, Tahina, which was published in 2008. The PalmTalk community subsequently spearheaded a drive to raise funds for its conservation. In 2020, the IPS launched its annual Save the Species campaign to raise awareness and funding for targeted palm conservation projects around the world. Save the Species target projects have included: 2020 Madagascar: Tahina spectabilis in partnership with Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. 2021 Colombia: Sabinaria magnifica in partnership with SalvaMontes. 2022 Hawaii: Pritchardia woodii in partnership with the National Tropical Botanic Garden. 2023 UK: Ravenea moorei in partnership with Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

" Since the establishment of the standard, the policy for compiling dictionaries has been to publish character books that are based on the assumption that all JIS basic Kanji characters are listed. However, for ghost characters included in JIS Basic Kanji, it is not possible to refer to past sources. Therefore, their treatment differed depending on the dictionaries and individual characters as follows. Assign readings for convenienceIn information equipment that implements JIS basic Kanji characters, it is not good enough that even ghost characters do not appear when converted as long as they are implemented. Therefore, they are often assigned a ""phonetic reading,"" which is interpreted as a form of phonetic writing for convenience. Some dictionaries also list these convenient readings. Hiroyuki Sasahara points out that these readings may have been given based on a research report by the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (1982) and published materials by NEC (1982) and IBM Japan (1983). Regarded as Glyph with similar charactersSome have assigned ""駲"" as a variant of ""馴"" and ""軅"" as a variant of ""軈"". However, none of these sources provide a source. The character ""妛"" is a variant of the very similar character ""妛"" (the upper ""山"" becomes ""屮"") found in the Dai Kan-Wa Jiten and Kangxi Dictionary. This is also introduced in the JIS X 0208:1997 survey with an example of implicit merging with an authoritative source. These two characters are also merged into the same code point in Unicode. Own interpretationSince ""竜"" is a variant of ""龍"", there is an interpretation that ""槞"" is a variant of ""櫳"". Some dictionaries consider ""鵈""=""耳(ear)""+""鳥(bird)"" to be the national character for Black kite a bird with a distinctive cry that lives abundantly in Japan. These are also introduced with authority in the JIS X 0208:1997 survey. Explain as unknownDescribe as is that the reading or significance is unknown. After the results of the aforementioned research were known, the contents of these are generally adopted in dictionaries. The Dai Kan-Wa Jiten published a supplemental volume in 2000, and the Kadokawa Shin Jigen (New Character Source) published a revised new edition in 2017, both of which include some of the characters whose sources have been identified."	Japan's JIS basic Kanji standard has been introduced in the 1970s and 80s, according to a new study by academic Hiroyuki Sasahara.

" Despite the Portuguese language not being widely spoken in Slovenia there is interest towards Portuguese culture, literature and products. The Portuguese language has a remarkable and projection in Slovenia, it is taught at the University of Ljubljana, and numerous works by great Portuguese-speaking writers and poets have been translated into Slovene in recent years. In 2021, two of the main works of exponents of Brazilian and Portuguese literature, Machado de Assis and Eça de Queirós, respectively ""Quincas Borba"" and ""O Crime do Padre Amaro"", were translated into Slovene.

" The renovations made by Robertson Ward from 1934 to 1935 converted both structures from an Italianate design to the Regency Revival style and also architecturally harmonized the two buildings. Ward added a loggia with columns and wall details including blind arches and paired pilasters supporting a frieze, cornice and pediment to the forecourt, which was separated from the street by a unique iron fence decorated with anchors and drafting tools that extended in front of No. 150. Lanterns on the sides of the front gate to the forecourt depict ""150"" and ""152"" to represent the house numbers of the complex. The front doorway to No. 152 is raised four steps from the ground and has glass side lights with delicate pilasters supporting a molded entablature and a transom; iron trellises were used in lieu of columns to support a scalloped bronze canopy covering the stoop. The front façade of the house has double-hung sash windows with black shutters and includes a frieze and a cornice crowned by a brick parapet. A formal garden was located behind No. 150, which contained a patch of grass edged with boxwood and was surrounded by pathways, shrubs and trees."

 Dūr-Abī-ešuḫ is attested to have been occupied during the reigns of four contiguous rulers of Babylon, Abi-Eshuh, Ammi-Ditana, Ammi-Saduqa and Samsu-Ditana. This period marked the slow decline of the Old Babylonian Empire from the glory days of Hammurabi and the early rise of the First Sealand Dynasty beginning under its first ruler Ilī-ma-AN. Under ruler Samsu-iluna, predecessor of Abi-Eshuh, Babylon lost effective control over Nippur to Ilī-ma-AN and Sealand. Abi-Eshuh fortified the southern region of the Babylonian empire and dammed the Tigris river and as a result full control of Nippur had been regained by his 5th year. It is known that on or about year 11 of the reign of Ammi-Ditana, successor in Babylon to Abi-Eshuh, the major city of Nippur came under attack and was again partially abandoned. Dūr-Abī-ešuḫ was pivotal in the defense of Nippur.	The present invention provides a method and means for the restoration of the glory days of murabi.

 Imambara Zadibal has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. From the period of Sultan Nazuk Shah by Mirza Douglat in 1548 AD to the reign of Maharaja Ranbir Singh in 1872 AD, this shrine was burnt down around eleven times. At the time Imambara Zadibal was constructed. However, Mirza Hyder Kashgari Douglat set this shrine on fire in 1548 AD. Daulat Chak began rebuilding it in 1551. Zafar Kupawari set Imambara Zadibal on fire for the second time in 1553. It was burned down again in 1653 during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. In 1682 AD, when Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir ruled, Imambara Zadibal was set on fire again. In 1719 AD, it was burned down for the fifth time during the Mukhtawi Khan clash. It caught fire for the sixth time in 1748 AD. Again in 1763. Imambara Zadibal caught fire again in June 1801, during Afghan rule in Kashmir, just before Ashura.In July 1830, the shrine was the site of a massacre when Jammu and Kashmir were under Sikh rule. This same day, many Shias were cruelly murdered. This happened at Ali Park in Zadibal or Margibal. Imambara Zadibal was rebuilt with the financial help sent by Nawab Hakim Mehndi Ali Khan, the prime minister of Awadh's King Nasir-ud-din Haider. This grant was sent to Haji Baqir Khan Irani, who passed on the duty of rebuilding this structure to Hatim Mir. In September 1872, the building was again set ablaze under the rule of Maharaja Ranbir Singh. He was a Dogra Ruler of J&K. This time, the king gave considerable financial aid of about Rs. 3 lakhs to renovate the Imambara and restore it to its current prosperous condition.

 In 1989, Lessa joined the Scuderie Detetive Le Cocq, a death squad created in 1965 to avenge the death of detective Milton Le Cocq d'Oliveira and that aimed at avenging the deaths of police officers as well. He distinguished himself in police operations in drug-trafficking dominated favelas by taking possession of seized assets from the traffickers. In 1991, he joined the Military Police and was transferred to the Civil Police in 2003, where he served until his retirement in 2010. During his service in these law enforcement agencies, he received honors at Alerj (State Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro) and a commendation at the City Council of Rio de Janeiro. According to the 2019 account from an experienced civil police officer who worked with Lessa and preferred not to be identified for safety reasons: He felt like a soldier in the midst of the Vietnam War. We conducted several operations together with a large part of the specialized police stations of the Civil Police. Bullets were flying, and their group appeared in the worst situations. Lessa was a serial killer. He had taken several shots, but he remained standing. He was a true war soldier. A killing machine. In 2009, Ronnie Lessa suffered serious injuries after a grenade detonated inside his car in the neighborhood of Bento Ribeiro. In an interview with Veja magazine, when asked about his relationship with Jair Bolsonaro, Lessa said that he was assisted by the then federal deputy to receive treatment at the Brazilian Beneficent Association for Rehabilitation.Lessa is also under investigation for the execution of two individuals that allegedly took place during a police operation in the Parque Colúmbia favela in September 2000.

 The slogan of The Farmlink Project is “Fighting food insecurity is our mission - repurposing surplus produce is our solution.” According to the website, “The Farmlink Project is acting as the “link” connecting the broken supply chains in the agricultural and access industries.” The Washington Post reported in 2020 that The Farmlink Project “raises money to pay farmers for produce and dairy that would otherwise be wasted, then funds the transportation to send the goods to food banks in the neediest areas around the country.” The Farmlink Project's website states that it will cover all shipping and logistics costs, organize and oversee all transportation and delivery logistics, work with all quantities, packaging, and produce of any form, and optimize and file for maximum possible value of tax benefits for farmers. In an interview with the Boston Globe, one of the original creators of the project explained that The Farmlink Project is founded and built by “more than 200 college students from about 30 colleges - including Stanford University, Cornell University, and Georgetown University - and other walks of life.”	The Farmlink Project's website states that it will cover all shipping and logistics costs, organize and oversee all transportation and delivery logistics.

Until recently Clarke worked at Forrester Creations, as the new head designer, after being hired by the new owners at that time, Nick (Jack Wagner) and Jackie Marone (Lesley-Anne Down). He was demoted to designer after Brooke returned to Forrester Creations and was made head designer. After Eric Forrester (John McCook) bought back Forrester Creations, he was under no obligation to honor Clarke's contract and Clarke was released from the company. Not too long after Jackie Marone and Dominick Marone sold Forrester Creations back to the Forresters, Clarke found himself once again back at Spectra Fashions. Because the new owners of Spectra Fashions had gone bankrupt, the company was reverted to Sally Spectra. As she no longer wanted to run the business, Sally Spectra asked Clarke and their son C.J. to sell the business for her. Knowing Jackie and her son would be interested, Clarke made his way to their home. One thing led to the next and Nick purchased the company making Clarke their head designer. The company was later renamed ""M Fashions"". Clarke worked at Jackie M Designs, the company formerly known as Spectra Fashions."	The character of Clarke Garrison was one of the main characters in the long-running US soap opera Days of Our Lives, which ran from 1987 to 2009.
 Players of John Company will consider some of the issues that affected the historical EIC between 1710 and the 1860s. For instance, players must decide whether or not to try and conquer the Indian kingdoms; if they do, they may install a Governor-General, and traffic the opium they control to China. Players may hire Indians to assist them; these include Sikhs, the Jagat Seth family, Awadh, Arcot, Orissa, the Nizam of Hyderabad, and a Rajput prince. Meanwhile, Indians may revolt against the Company; in the real world, this led to the EIC's downfall, due to the Indian Revolt of 1857. The exact setup rules depend on the scenario the players choose, reflecting the historical fortunes of India and the EIC. For the 1710 or long 1710 scenarios, the Company has no debt, weak armies, and no ships. If the game starts in 1758, the Calico Acts will already have been passed, there is a governor in Bengal, the Company is already in debt, and Mysore and Bombay are stronger than in 1710. For an 1813 scenario, the Company has larger armies and more ships, while Bombay is weaker but the Punjab stronger. The laws players consider voting on also reflect historical fact. One card in the deck represents the Calico Acts; historically, these banned imports of cotton (as the EIC had been doing) and helped the rise and industrialization of the British cotton industry. If passed, the game card simulates this by reducing Company profits and allowing players to buy extra workshops while rewarding those who already have them; it also has support in Parliament, which reflects how MPs represented local economies dependent on textiles, while the rents of many Lords were connected to the wool industry. The Writer Privileges law, on the other hand, has less support in Parliament, but allows the players to gain extra money from trading in India, and makes future votes to deregulate the Company easier; a historical note on the card explains that reducing restrictions led to cheaper prices for Indian goods in Britain, which led to more support for deregulation. Players may also debate whether to recruit sepoys (Indian soldiers), extend the franchise (reducing the value of rotten boroughs and making it more expensive to buy votes), or provide relief for famines in India. These reflect issues Britain and the EIC faced in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the Reform Act 1832, Chartism, and several famines which affected India. One of the game's topics is the relationship between the EIC's actions in India and British culture then and now, and how reliant Britain was on its empire. For example, if the Company is successful, players will have more money and votes with which to influence Parliament; but whether it is or not, its violent actions will inevitably affect on its own culture.	A computer game and a method of playing a computer game are disclosed. In one aspect, the computer game includes a plurality of players controlling a plurality of entities in a real world. In another aspect, the computer game includes a historical timeline comprising a portion of the real world.
 Both the Flyers and Islanders, two expansion teams established in 1967 and 1972, respectively, saw success and winning early into their franchises histories, something unusual among most expansion franchises in NHL history. By the time the two teams met for their first playoff matchup in the 1975 semifinals, the Flyers had just won the Stanley Cup in the previous season, in just their seventh season of existence. The Islanders were making their first playoff appearance in just their third season of existence. The Islanders had advanced to the semifinals after becoming the second team in NHL history to come back from a 3–0 series deficit, as they defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins in seven games. In the series, the Flyers, the first seed, jumped to a 3–0 series lead over the Islanders. However, the Islanders responded by winning the next three games to force a game seven, but unlike their quarterfinal matchup, they were unable to complete the comeback, as the Flyers prevailed in game seven, 4–1. The Flyers advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals and defeated the Buffalo Sabres to win their second straight Stanley Cup. Both teams would continue to be playoff contenders for the remainder of the decade.	Two of the largest expansion teams in the US, the New York City flyers and the Jersey Islanders, have made their first appearances in a decade.
" Addressing feudalism would necessitate a distinct kind of association with England. Historically, the fidelity of the local lords played a pivotal role in the Channel Islands' choice to remain under the English monarch. Central to this intricate relationship is the practice and importance of fiefs, deeply ingrained in Norman tradition. In Normandy, and subsequently in the Channel Islands, fiefs were deemed of utmost significance, as eloquently described in the Coutume de Normandie (the legal customs of Normandy): ""Je ne sais pas quelles sont ces dignités qui peuvent être possédés sans fond ni glebe, et pour lesquelles on doit hommage et non relief, à la réserve de certaines sargenteries qui n'ont point de glebe. Ces fiefs en l'air sont fiefs impropres; proprie enim feudum in rebus soli constitit.""transl. ""I do not know what these dignities are that can be held without foundation or glebe, and for which homage is due and not relief, except for certain sargenteries that have no glebe. These floating fiefs are improper fiefs; for a proper fief rests on tangible assets."" The Coutume elucidates the divergence between Norman and English practices: ""(en Normandie) on n'en use pas comme en Angleterre, où les dignités des Ducs & Comtes ne sont pas attachées aux fiefs. Ce sont des dignités personnelles que le ROI donne à qui lui plaît, et tel s'appelle Duc & comte de Warwick, de Northumberland... mais même n'y a rien du tout.""transl. ""(In Normandy) they do not operate as they do in England, where the titles of Dukes & Counts aren't tethered to fiefs. These are personal titles bestowed by the KING at his discretion, and someone might be named Duke & Count of Warwick, Northumberland... yet they don't hold any tangible property."" This distinction rests upon the inherent value placed on possessing glebe (landed estates) in the Channel Islands. While firmly rooted in Norman traditions, it contrasts sharply with the English approach. The Channel Islands' feudal tradition is commonly recognized as one of the unique characteristics that distinguish the islands and grants them a special status. As C. Northcote Parkinson once remarked: ""Without its feudalism, Guernsey as a tourist resort would be little different from Bognor Regis."""	Guernsey's feudal tradition has a significant impact on the English monarchy, according to the Duke and Counts of Warwick.
" Early Abiy Ahmed tenure was characterized by major reforms in human rights, including releasing several political prisoners that were detained by EPRDF regime. After the Tigrayan rebels captured Amhara Region, Abiy declared state of emergency on 2 November 2021, encouraging mass arrests individuals ""suspected of collaborating with terrorist groups"" without warrant. The US government, various human rights groups and mainstream media accused the declaration of ethnic profiling against Tigrayans. Secret vigilantes operated in Addis Ababa and submitted individuals to the government supposed supporting the TPLF and OLA rebels. Tigrayan civilians were mostly detained in Western Tigray Zone. The detentions continued after the state of emergency in the capital Addis Ababa, targeting towards to some UN staffs members who were taken from their homes. According to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, 16 staff members of Ethiopian citizen detained while six others were freed. On 20 May 2022, Brigadier General Tefera Mamo, who led the Amharan army against Tigrayan force during the Tigray War, was arrested after a comment criticizing Abiy and his affiliation in Amhara region of being ""motivated by money"". Also, by 23 May 2022, the number of arrest has been inclined; 4,500 journalists and activists were arrested in what is called ""law enforcement operations"" by the government. While Abiy state the mass arrest is justified because of stability and security reasons, critics accused the government of utterly human rights violation, including extrajudicial killings. On 5 January 2023, the Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO) experts Daniel Tesfaye, Bezuayehu Wondimu, Bereket Daniel and Nahom Husen went to a village called Alem Bank in west Addis Ababa to investigate people whose houses are demolished by the Addis Ababa municipal government. While gathering information around, unidentified police forces detained the four and forcefully disappeared for several hours until they relocated to Gelan Gudan Police Station. They were brought in Sebeta police station. Police alleged that they haven't permission letters to inform Oromia authority to carry out investigation."	The government, various human rights groups and mainstream media accused the declaration of ethnic profiling againstrayans.

 In 1980, a foreign activist cut nets to release 250 to 300 dolphins caught in fishing on Iki Island. : 80–81 Peter Singer, a researcher in ethical philosophy, came to Japan from Australia to defend. A Japanese district court sentenced the activist to six months in prison, suspended for three years. In December 1980, a joint operation between Futo and Kawana was being conducted in Futo, when a small whale escaped by foreign activists. 。 Demand for dolphins increased as a substitute for whales around the time of the commercial whaling moratorium. The number of porpoises captured increased from 16,515 in 1986 to 40,367 in 1988. As a result, catch limits were established for each fishing method and for each dolphin species, beginning with the 1991 porpoises.	The number of porpoises caught in Japan has increased by more than three-quarters since the end of the commercial whaling moratorium in 1988.
 For more than half a century, Zhang made her home in Xi’an, Shaan’xi Province. Her works focus on the unity and harmonious relationship between science and aesthetics, as well as between vernacular and modern. In the 1970s, she undertook the restoration of building structures and gardens of the Tang dynasty. Her ideas on utilising technological and scientific advancements were realised in her conservation and heritage projects, most notably the Shaanxi History Museum. The project is described as a modern architectural project by which traditional architectural elements are used as ingredients of innovation. Beyond revitalising the ancient city and its history, Zhang’s designs present architecture features of the past in the modern context. This approach, often referred as the “Neo-Tang Style”, gained popularity through her works.	One of China's best-known architects and conservationists, Zhang Zuying, has died at the age of 83 after a long illness.
 Informateur Wim van der Grinten explored the possibility of bringing together PvdA, CDA and D'66 without success. The former KVP state secretary was appointed on the recommendation of Van Agt to 'investigate the possibilities of forming a cabinet in the shortest possible time that can be confident of receiving sufficient support from the parliament'. Van der Grinten tried to force a breakthrough with various compromises, but together with the negotiators he concluded that the 'implementation problem' was unsolvable. Van der Grinten then investigated whether PvdA wanted to work with VVD, but Van Thijn rejected this. The discussions between CDA and VVD subsequently led to an agreement within a week. The conversations between Van Agt and Wiegel started on 14 November. On Wiegel's recommendation, they decided to strive to keep it short and concise. Wiegel's proposal to keep the outside world - including their factions - out was also adopted. Even council advisor Herman Tjeenk Willink and director of the Government Information Service Gijs van der Wiel, who had always been there until then, were sent away. Already in the first conversation they managed to make agreements about the WIR, the VAD, the works councils and the distribution of ministerial posts. Parts of the agreement with PvdA and D'66 were adopted, such as the abortion paragraph. What helped was the good atmosphere between the party leaders, in contrast to the conversations between Van Agt with Van Thijn and Den Uyl. The draft agreement was sent to the factions on 22 November. The VVD quickly agreed, but under pressure from ARP members such as Aantjes and Scholten, dozens of amendments were submitted. Wiegel responded with understanding and an amended agreement was reached on 26 November. The VVD faction unanimously agreed to the result on 28 November. An extensive consultation took place at the CDA, which continued until the early morning. The majority voted in favor, but six faction members — Aantjes, Hans de Boer, Beumer, Van Houwelingen, Scholten (all from ARP) and Dijkman (KVP) — voted against. They indicated that they tolerated the cabinet and were known as the CDA loyalists. During a faction meeting on 5 December Willem de Kwaadsteniet also joined this group. Because of this tolerating support, there was some commotion, because Van der Grinten's assignment was to create a parliamentary majority cabinet. PvdA objected to this, but this had no effect. On 2 December the parties reached an agreement in principle on the distribution of ministerial posts. Van Agt was the intended prime minister, after Jelle Zijlstra, Pierre Lardinois, Jan van den Brink and Roelof Nelissen had resigned. Wiegel was intended as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior. Van der Grinten submitted his final report on 6 December.	Wim van der Grinten was appointed on the recommendation of Van Agt to 'investigate the possibilities of forming a cabinet in the shortest possible time that can be confident of receiving sufficient support from the parliament' The discussions between CDA and VVD subsequently led to an agreement within a week.
 On the amavasya (new moon day) of the Hindu month of Ashadha, devotees observe Dashama vrat by installing a Sandhani made of soil in their home. Devotees also install a murti (icon) or image of the goddess Dashama with an icon of the Hindu god Ganesha. Devotees who observe this vrat wear the Kautuka (red-coloured thread) with 10 knots on their right hand on the first day and eat once a day (ek tanu). Daily, devotees perform puja (ritual worship), Aarti, reads the katha (legend) and then eats prasadi (food offering). Devotees also participate in Jagaran, a night vigil of prayer and worship. The vrat is observed for 10 days. On the last day, devotees observe the jagaran and around 4-5 AM, the murti is immersed into a water body like a river.	The Hindu festival of Dashama is celebrated in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu (Madras) every year in the month of Ashadha.

 The minority stress model takes into account significant stressors that distinctly affect the mental health of those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or another non-conforming gender identity. Some risk factors that contribute to declining mental health are heteronormativity, discrimination, harassment, rejection (e.g., family rejection and social exclusion), stigma, prejudice, denial of civil and human rights, lack of access to mental health resources, lack of access to gender-affirming spaces (e.g., gender-appropriate facilities), and internalized homophobia. The structural circumstance where a non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming individual is embedded in significantly affects the potential sources of risk. The compounding of these everyday stressors increase poor mental health outcomes among individuals in the LGBT community. Evidence shows that there is a direct association between LGBT individuals' development of severe mental illnesses and the exposure to discrimination.In addition, there are a lack of access to mental health resources specific to LGBT individuals and a lack of awareness about mental health conditions within the LGBT community that restricts patients from seeking help.	The minority stress model takes into account significant stressors that distinctly affect the mental health of those who identify as non-conforming.

 Of the monetary units that are included in the ISO 4217 standard and exist in cash, only the Panamanian balboa is not issued in the form of banknotes - the local population in Panama uses balboa coins and US dollar banknotes. Also, in real money circulation, there are some other monetary units only in the form of coins. This is due to the spread of a parallel currency in the relevant territory: Tuvaluan dollar and Kiribati dollar - Australian dollar banknotes are used; Pitcairn Islands dollar - banknotes of the New Zealand dollar are used; Timorese and Ecuadorian centavo - US dollar banknotes are used; in Madagascar, coins of the Malagasy franc remain in circulation, while banknotes and coins of the Malagasy ariary are mainly used.

" On April 8, the Ottoman army passed Ochkhamuri, but did not go through the valley and took refuge in the forest between Ochkhamuri and Cholok. Mazniashvili ordered the armored train to retreat. The armored personnel carrier was supposed to be in the rearguard, but then he shared the plan of Vladimir Goguadze, the head of the armored personnel carrier: To break into the enemy's positions and conduct a battle. The battle began at five o'clock in the morning on April 7. An armored train broke into the ranks of the enemy. But the Georgian side did not open fire either from the train or from the trenches, because it had received such an order. Only the artillery, which was handed over to Kargaretli, opened fire on the opponent. Whether the Ottomans approached the train or not, they opened fire. The Georgians opened fire from the train as well as from trenches and trenches. The Ottoman soldiers found in the open field were killed in large numbers. After six hours of the battle, an Ottoman dragster hit the armored car and threw the first car of the train off the tracks, and another attack was made on the armored car by a new thousand from the west. Goguadze had run out of hope and pressed the button with which the armored personnel carrier was supposed to explode, the enemy would only be left with iron fragments, but the wire leading from the remote control to the mine was broken and the mine did not come into action. In the meantime, Akaki Urushadze, who was sent to ask for additional help, came to Mazniashvili and a 400-man detachment of the Gori Guard joined the battle. The Ottomans finally broke and began to retreat. The Georgians came out of the trenches and reached the fleeing enemy to the bridge of Ochkhamuri before 4 o'clock in the day. The Ottoman army retreated 4 kilometers. In the battle, 3 people were killed and 25 wounded on the Georgian side. On the side of the Ottomans, according to Mazniashvili's estimate, up to 500 people were killed, and according to other Georgian military leaders, up to 1000 people were killed.

" While awaiting trial, Snowden was housed in the Ada County jail. On September 28, 1956, Snowden asked for and received a court-appointed attorney. On October 5, 1956, he pleaded not guilty to the charges. However, on October 18, 1956, he changed his plea to guilty. After verifying that Snowden understood his guilty plea waived his right to a trial by jury and could lead to a life sentence or an execution, Judge M. Oliver Koelsch scheduled a hearing for October 23 to determine the degree of murder Snowden committed, as well as a punishment. The court ultimately determined that Snowden's crime was a first-degree murder and that there were no mitigating circumstances they could identify to justify reducing his punishment, so on October 26, Snowden was sentenced to death. His death sentence was initially scheduled to be carried out on December 7, 1956, but Snowden's lawyer filed a notice of appeal on his behalf, causing the initial execution date to be automatically delayed. In his appeal, Snowden argued that Dean's murder did not meet the criteria of a first-degree murder because he did not exhibit ""malice aforethought."" Snowden's attorney also requested a commutation of Snowden's sentence based on purported mental illness, as well as based on the argument that the crime more closely resembled second-degree murder or manslaughter, rather than first-degree murder, and that the death penalty was a disproportionately harsh punishment. In a unanimous opinion, the Idaho Supreme Court rejected Snowden's appeal. In September 1957, Judge Koelsch set Snowden's execution date for October 18, 1957."

 One of the former shaft buildings had been converted into a casino and ballroom; it was demolished in the 1980s due to its dilapidated state. After the closure of the coalfields, the stables opposite the old shaft were bought by a private owner before being destroyed by fire. The ruins remained until they were demolished on May 31, 2006. At the beginning of the 21st century, no trace of the installations remained (apart from the ruins of a small outbuilding) and the shaft was located under a pavilion at the foot of a hill. In September 2012, a commemorative monument to early mining was built near the old shaft. It is made up of two minecarts and a wood framing.	The ruins of one of the oldest coalfields in the UK have been unearthed by the National Museum of Art in New York.
 The model of the Chinese Mongolian is the same as that of the Mongolian horse. It is considered locally as a horse because of this model and not as a pony. The head has a rectilinear profile and is rather heavy, with a broad forehead, open nostrils, protruding eyes, and long ears. The neck is short and muscular, the chest deep, the shoulder fairly sloping and muscular. The withers are not very prominent; the back is short, solid, and straight. The croup is long and sloping. The legs are short, strong, and solid. The breed is renowned for its solid constitution. The average height is 1.28 m, 1.27 m for mares, and 1.30 m for males. Weight ranges from 300 to 360 kg, with an average of 360 for males and 300 for females. There are variations according to type. For example, the University of Oklahoma study, dating from 2007, gives a size range from 1.21 to 1.42 m, and CAB International, in its study published in 2016, 1.22 to 1.42 m. Size increases markedly when environmental conditions are favorable.	The model of the Chinese Mongolian is the same as that of the Mongolian horse.

" The Ius in Memoria are akin to Ius in Bello, in focusing more on the ""how"" of commemoration. It has four criteria: Transcend the Collectives. Commemoration is seen as ethical if it encourages people to treat each other as individuals rather than group representatives. Exit Circular Narratives. Commemoration should help people exit narratives that trap them in debilitating interpretative loops. Assert Moral Autonomy. Groups should justify their actions in universal terms, rather than excusing transgressions with reference to what others have done. Contained Unfathomability. Good commemoration should be precise with dates, locations and names to tether past trauma. Numerical aspects of trauma should typically be communicated in broad categories. Proponents of the approach argue that taken together, the framework can constitute a comprehensive ethical approach or paradigm for commemoration. They concede that critiques of the just war tradition also apply to this moral framework, in that both pacifist and realist/revolutionary alternatives retain their validity."	ion is ethical if it encourages people to treat each other as individuals rather than group representatives.
" The building of the museum was originally a house established by a merchant named ""Abd al-Jabbar al-Khudairi"" in the late 19th century. It at one point belonged to Halil Kut of the Ottoman Empire. The house became a distinguished heritage building in terms of planning, architectural elements, distinguished woodwork, shanasheel, and the neighborhoods where the house was located. The Ministry of Tourism maintained the house and revived it as a heritage museum for Abd-al Karim Qasim. The museum contains Qasim's personal belongings and rare gifts. After maintenance, the museum was opened on the 9th of February, 2015, and was attended by his family and loved ones, as well as official, academic and cultural figures. The museum was opened to preserve the history of the country so that future generations can be aware of it. It also hinted that a similar museum in Basra dedicated to poet Badr Shakir al-Sayyab could be opened. The museum includes five halls, the first of which included the personal belongings of the leader, and the other was allocated for gifts, weapons, archives, and documents."	A museum dedicated to the former leader of Iraq, Abd-al Karim Qasim, has opened in the capital, Basra.
 “My works always seem to present a magical, dreamy, and even surreal style and it is because what I want to create is not just a beautiful space, but a spatial experience for visitors.” “Design creates value.” Li Xiang’s work involves the exploration of artistic expression, practicality, and creating new paradigms for futuristic design. The inspiration for her work is derived from her ambition to make the world a better place by making space both a beautiful and spatial experience based on the image of a world she would like to see. It is noted that Li Xiang’s workflow approach is considered unconventional when compared to other architectural practices, where the initial design phase involves mainly working digitally to allow for flexibility and rarely ever on paper.	Chinese architectural artist Li Xiang has created her latest work, which aims to make space more accessible to visitors.
 The main Swedish consumer cooperative organisation, Kooperativa Förbundet (KF), was founded in 1899, with the organisation being a dominant player in the Swedish market throughout the 20th century. The main brand of KF stores was Konsum, though it was one among many, with many different chains existing within the KF organisation. Ahead of the merger into Coop Norden KF centralised their branding under the Coop name in the early 2000s, with larger Konsum stores becoming Coop Konsum, and various hypermarket brands being centralised as Coop Forum.In 2015 the Coop chain was rebranded as part of a reorganisation within the KF organisation, with stores being branded under the Coop, Stora Coop and the short-lived Lilla Coop names.

 The Alvars (Tamil: ஆழ்வார், romanized: Āḻvār, lit. 'The Immersed') were the Tamil poet-saints of South India who espoused bhakti (devotion) to the Hindu deity Maha Vishnu, in their songs of longing, ecstasy, and service. They are venerated in Vaishnavism, which regards Vishnu as the Ultimate Reality. The devotional outpourings of the Alvars, composed during the early medieval period of Tamil history, were the catalysts behind the Bhakti Movement through their hymns of worship to Vishnu and his avatars. They praised the Divya Desams, the 108 divine realms of deities affiliated to Vaishnavism. The poetry of the Alvars echoes bhakti to God through love, and in the ecstasy of such devotions they sang hundreds of songs which embodied both depth of feeling and the felicity of expressions. The collection of their hymns is known as the Naalayira Divya Prabandham. The bhakti literature that sprang from Alvars has contributed to the establishment and sustenance of a culture that deviated from the Vedic religion and rooted itself in devotion as the only path for salvation. In addition, they contributed to Tamil devotional verses independent of a knowledge of Sanskrit.	The Alvars were Tamil poet-saints who espoused bhakti (devotion) to the Hindu deity Maha Vishnu.

" In an interview with series creator Reki Kawahara, the author noted that the female characters in Sword Art Online were not based on anyone he knew in the real world, with him stating ""I don’t usually make a character, setting, or anything before I start writing. As I write the story, the girls become what they are now. So, somehow, I don’t know exactly, but somehow, my subliminal idea or some hidden emotion creates the characters to be strong and capable."" Kawahara also added that he wrote the series to demonstrate that he views online gaming not as a social ill or escape from real life, and thus decided to show games in a more positive light in his light novels."

 What was initially reported as sewage was found to be about 1,000 US gallons (3,800 L; 830 imp gal) of a chemical mixture consisting of some sort of organic peroxide. In the first days of the investigation, officials speculated that two inert chemicals accidentally mixed in the truck and created an organic peroxide substance with sulfuric acid appearing to be part of the mix. Organic peroxide combines unstably bound oxygen together with hydrogen and carbon in the same molecule and ignites easily and then burns rapidly and intensely. While field testing was performed on the reactive material for initial identification, the county hazardous materials manager found that laboratories would not test the chemicals over concerns that lab personnel could be injured or their equipment damaged. Three weeks after the incident, the substance was still highly susceptible to friction and seemed to react to something as slight as wind. Sodium chlorite was identified in an internal investigation by the firm in the months following the disaster. They claimed that the chemical was being using as a water treatment agent for the first time and was stored in the same type of storage container as wastewater. The company said they treat about 100 different streams of waste. The owner of facility said that they never had a major problem such as this since the plant only takes non-hazardous waste. The worker combined the chemical with wastewater in the vacuum truck where the chemical interacting with organic material caused an explosion that blew off the back of the truck. A former county district attorney, retained by a company attorney, issued a report in March 2015 that provided an explanation of events indicating that the worker may have accidentally combined the chemicals. Later, investigators found that an inspection by a Defense Logistics Agency contractor was scheduled for that morning and officials of the firm had directed the transfer of these hazardous materials to another location.	A chemical which exploded in a vacuum truck in the US state of Ohio earlier this year may have been used to treat hazardous waste, it has emerged.
 The watershed of what is just called the Winter brook encompasses entirely the watershed of the Winter brook, Big brook, Black Water, and Hulpe. The source area of the Winter brook is in Korspel, a hamlet of Beringen. In the downstream direction to the west, three streams combine to contribute to the flow of the Winter brook, among them the Genemeer brook. As a result of mine subsidence, the water management in this source area was disturbed, leading to the reversal of the flow direction of the Genemeer brook, which ceased to join the Winter brook. As a result, a new connection was established from the source area of this stream to Winter brook. Between the villages of Beverlo and Beringen Mine, the brook flows westward, guided through a siphon under the Albert Canal. It now continues southwestward, passing to the north of the Paalse Lake and southeast of Tessenderlo and Deurne. Until this stage, it falls within the classification as a second-class non-navigable watercourse. Near the Paalse Lake, it becomes a watercourse of the first category due to high pollution. Further downstream, Small brook and Middle brook (Dutch:Middelbeek) run parallel to the Winter brook, and the name changes to Big brook. The valley with these parallel running streams is known as the Valley of the Three Brooks. The brook flows south of Deurne, along the area of Asdonk. When the Small brook merges into the Big brook, the name changes to Black Water. This name is given to the dark color that the water acquires due to the presence of peat soil. Beyond Molenstede, there is another name change, and the brook becomes the Hulpe, named after a significant side stream that joins it. Under the name Hulpe, it flows through the Demer Marshes before finally joining the Demer River. In the western part of the watershed, the valley is flanked by escarpments composed of iron sandstone. These escarpments are up to 30 meters higher than their surroundings.

" Typically a skimmer draws water from the pool through a rectangular opening in the wall, at the top of the pool, connected through a device installed in one (or more) walls of the pool. The internal parts of the skimmer are accessed from the pool deck through a circular or rectangular cover, approximately one foot in diameter. If the pool's water pump is operational, it draws water from the pool through a hinged floating chute (which operates from a vertical position at a 90-degree angle to the pool, to prevent leaves and debris from being washed back into the pool by wave action), and down into a removable ""skimmer basket"", whose purpose is to catch leaves, dead insects and other larger floating debris. The opening visible from the side of the pool is usually 1'0"" (300 mm) wide by 6"" (150 mm) high, which cuts the water halfway down the center of the opening. Skimmers with wider openings are called ""wide angle"" skimmers and can be up to 2'0"" wide (600 mm). Floating skimmers have the advantage of not being affected by water level, as they adjust to work with the suction rate of the pump and will maintain optimal skimming regardless of water level, leading to a significantly reduced amount of biomaterial in the water. Skimmers should always have a leaf basket or filter between it and the pump to avoid clogging the pipes leading to the pump and filter."	Floating skimmers have been installed at a swimming pool in the Isle of Wight, which is being used to catch leaves and debris.
 After seeing the election of Tōru Hashimoto, who also went to Osaka Prefectural Kitano High School, he retired from civil service in November 2007 and decided to become a politician. He first ran for Mayor of Taishi in 2008, but lost against two other candidates in a landslide. He ran three more times for office, twice for Mayor of Nishinomiya and once for Hyogo Prefectural Assembly, but also lost.In April 2011, Nonomura ran for Hyogo Prefectural Assembly for the Nishinomiya City constituency, which consisted of seven seats up for election. He went under the party Nishinomiya Restoration Party, and with 11,291 votes, Nonomura was elected as an assemblymember. As an assemblymember, he was active as a nonpartisan politician.

 The Pan-ArcticVision is quite unique in the way that it is one of few attempts to not just the euro-arctic region, the Barents region, the Nordics, the American arctic or the international inuit community, but to in fact include the whole circumpolar North. The first edition of the Pan-ArcticVision was arranged in Vadsø, Northern Norway, a town of ca 6000 people located on the brink of the European mainland. The event was hosted by the local festival Varangerfestivalen. The project was initiated, financed and run by Nordting - the Northern Assembly, and led by artistic director and entrepreneur Amund Sjølie Sveen. == References ==	The subject matter of this patent application is that it is one of few attempts to not just the euro-arctic region, the Earthents region, the Siments region, the Internationals, the arctic or the international inuit community, but in fact include the whole circumpolar.
 On January 13, 1765, Van Eck, accompanied by Koopman and other officers, embarked on a journey from Colombo to rendezvous with an army stationed at Gonavila. Their route took them through Negombo and Tambaravila. Subsequent intelligence revealed that the Kandyans were bolstering their forces and fortifications, actively preparing for a potential invasion. Despite numerous challenges including widespread illnesses and frequent skirmishes, the Dutch army managed to persevere and eventually reached Kandy. Their journey led them through various locations, including Katugampola, Etambole, Visnave, Pidaravala, Kurunegala, Teliangona, and Vauda. Their final destination was the heavily fortified Galagedra fortress, which posed significant challenges to overcome. Nevertheless, after a day of concerted efforts, the fortress was successfully captured. The main army successfully crossed the Hoenay Oya on the morning of February 16. Upon reaching Katugastota along the banks of the Mahaweli River, they encountered another colonel who had already established a camp in the vicinity. Occupying the king's pleasure residence, they proceeded to plunder it. Subsequently, on February 19, they crossed the river. Arriving at the king's palace, they observed the king's absence. This led them to remain there for three days, during which they engaged in looting and plundering. Notably, substantial Kandyan forces emerged, bearing white flags as a sign of submission to the company. This event unfolded on February 22, and Van Eck, in response, conducted promotions for army officers and generals. The invasion proceeded with notable success, characterized by a lack of setbacks. Swiftly advancing and overcoming every Kandyan army they encountered, they demonstrated remarkable progress. In a parallel effort, another contingent led by Colonel Wesel, numbering 700 men, set out to dismantle the king's alternate palace. Upon receiving information that the king was residing there. Upon reaching the palace, it became evident that the king had fled again, the soldiers plundered and looted it again. As this group returned, they fell victim to an ambush, resulting in the unfortunate death of 48 soldiers on March 4. On the same day, Van Eck, along with fellow officers, journeyed back to Colombo. During their absence, Colonel Feber assumed responsibility for overseeing the occupation. Van Eck's return was met with a warm welcome and congratulations for the successful campaign. However, news soon arrived that the Kandyans had adopted guerrilla warfare tactics, launching an attack on a transport and a farm. Colonel Feber, who was in charge of the occupation, sought additional reinforcements in response to sporadic guerrilla warfare activities. Subsequently, following a significant engagement between Dutch forces and Kandyan insurgents on March 24th, reinforcements successfully entered occupied Kandy. During a battle while marching to Feber, Major Franken's troops emerged victorious against the Kandyan forces, compelling them to retreat to higher terrain. After a period of illness within the Dutch ranks and subsequent skirmishes with the Kandyan adversaries, diplomatic negotiations eventually led to the establishment of a peace agreement.	The Dutch army's chief general, Colonel Jan van Eck, was among the first officers to be appointed to oversee the invasion of Sri Lanka by the rebels.
" On April 8, the Ottoman army passed Ochkhamuri, but did not go through the valley and took refuge in the forest between Ochkhamuri and Cholok. Mazniashvili ordered the armored train to retreat. The armored personnel carrier was supposed to be in the rearguard, but then he shared the plan of Vladimir Goguadze, the head of the armored personnel carrier: To break into the enemy's positions and conduct a battle. The battle began at five o'clock in the morning on April 7. An armored train broke into the ranks of the enemy. But the Georgian side did not open fire either from the train or from the trenches, because it had received such an order. Only the artillery, which was handed over to Kargaretli, opened fire on the opponent. Whether the Ottomans approached the train or not, they opened fire. The Georgians opened fire from the train as well as from trenches and trenches. The Ottoman soldiers found in the open field were killed in large numbers. After six hours of the battle, an Ottoman dragster hit the armored car and threw the first car of the train off the tracks, and another attack was made on the armored car by a new thousand from the west. Goguadze had run out of hope and pressed the button with which the armored personnel carrier was supposed to explode, the enemy would only be left with iron fragments, but the wire leading from the remote control to the mine was broken and the mine did not come into action. In the meantime, Akaki Urushadze, who was sent to ask for additional help, came to Mazniashvili and a 400-man detachment of the Gori Guard joined the battle. The Ottomans finally broke and began to retreat. The Georgians came out of the trenches and reached the fleeing enemy to the bridge of Ochkhamuri before 4 o'clock in the day. The Ottoman army retreated 4 kilometers. In the battle, 3 people were killed and 25 wounded on the Georgian side. On the side of the Ottomans, according to Mazniashvili's estimate, up to 500 people were killed, and according to other Georgian military leaders, up to 1000 people were killed. According to Dr. Vakhtang Gambashidze, the Ottomans were transporting 600 wounded soldiers to Batumi. According to ""Georgia"" newspaper, 80 were killed on the Ottoman side, 2 soldiers were captured. Georgians captured 20 rifles."	The battle of Ochkhamuri, which took place on the morning of April 7, 1914, was ordered by the Georgian army commander, Kargaretli Mazniashvili.
" The renovations made by Robertson Ward from 1934 to 1935 converted both structures from an Italianate design to the Regency Revival style and also architecturally harmonized the two buildings. Ward added a loggia with columns and wall details including blind arches and paired pilasters supporting a frieze, cornice and pediment to the forecourt, which was separated from the street by a unique iron fence decorated with anchors and drafting tools that extended in front of No. 150. Lanterns on the sides of the front gate to the forecourt depict ""150"" and ""152"" to represent the house numbers of the complex.The front doorway to No. 152 is raised four steps from the ground and has glass side lights with delicate pilasters supporting a molded entablature and a transom; iron trellises were used in lieu of columns to support a scalloped bronze canopy covering the stoop. The front façade of the house has double-hung sash windows with black shutters and includes a frieze and a cornice crowned by a brick parapet. A formal garden was located behind No. 150, which contained a patch of grass edged with boxwood and was surrounded by pathways, shrubs and trees."	This is a unique architectural and residential complex with a unique iron fence decorated with anchors and drafting tools that extended in front of the front gate.

 The Fifth Circuit analyzed whether Bitcoin transaction records are protected by the Fourth Amendment. The court likened Bitcoin transactions to bank records, which are not protected by the Fourth Amendment under the third-party doctrine. This doctrine holds that a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties. The court ruled that Gratkowski voluntarily disclosed information about his Bitcoin transactions to third parties (i.e., all users globally of the Bitcoin network and Coinbase), and therefore he had no reasonable expectation of privacy in this information. Affirming the district court's denial of Gratkowski's motion to suppress the evidence, the court ruled that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in Bitcoin transaction records on the blockchain or held by a third-party exchange like Coinbase, thus such records are not protected by the Fourth Amendment. The case was decided by a panel consisting of Circuit Judges Carl E. Stewart, James L. Dennis, and Catharina Haynes, with Judge Haynes delivering the opinion of the court.

" The mining companies that were involved, and most prominent in the Vancouver Islands at the time, were: The Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Limited, the Western Fuel of San Francisco, the Pacific Coast Collieries, and the Nanaimo Coal Company. The Canadian Collieries were based in Cumberland and Extension. Owned by the Dunsmuir family, the company played a significant role in the strike by firing a union leader with the last name ""Mottishaw"". This was one of the strike's leading causes. The Western Fuel of San Francisco was based in Nanaimo and owned many of the mines there. The Pacific Coast Collieries only had minor involvement, and were located in South Wellington. The Nanaimo Coal Company stands apart from the other three, as it was the sole company to ""sign an agreement with the union. ""These mining companies (excluding the Nanaimo Coal Company) were opposed to the unions, because they were a threat to the coal companies' power and authority. They coal companies were also dealing with the competition of fuel oil. Because of the potential replacement of coal as fuel with oil as fuel, they worked the miners extra hard and with less pay. This was in an effort to keep up with fuel oil and to stay in business. They needed to pay workers less in order to make a profit. However, unions demanded more pay, causing an issue for the coal companies. They did not want to increase the miners' pay, at the risk of losing their business, and of the entire coal mining industry being replaced by an alternate fuel source. They also had the support of the government, because the economy was so dependent upon the coal industry."

" Clark spent over a decade in print journalism, including a stint as Sports Assignment Editor for USA Today. While filling that role, Clark says he pushed for better media coverage of bowling, feeling that the media ""never treated bowling fairly."" As industry insiders read and responded to Clark's articles, it led to his first job in the bowling business as Chief Marketing Officer for the United States Bowling Congress (USBC) in 2005. In April 2008, he was hired as Deputy Commissioner of the PBA, working under then-Commissioner and CEO Fred Schreyer. Clark's time as Deputy Commissioner coincided with the collapse of the U.S. financial industry in 2008 and 2009. Faced with financial issues, the PBA and ESPN jointly worked on ways to cut costs. One idea was to hold multiple tournaments in one location which could have the final rounds recorded and aired at a later date, thus saving on talent and crew travel costs. It also reduced the travel costs for PBA players, who are essentially independent contractors that take care of their own travel expenses. The result was the very first PBA World Series of Bowling, which Clark takes credit for creating, held August-September 2009 in Allen Park, Michigan. The World Series of Bowling continues through the present, and held its 14th annual event in 2023."	As the new president of the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA), Gary Clark will take charge of the PBA's business operations, including the World Series of Bowling.

" In the Rocky Mountain Range area of the Western United States, powder skiing is a common term used among expert skiers. Alf Engen, an early contributor to constructing 27 ski resorts in the Rocky Mountain Range, is known as the pioneer of powder skiing. The skiing public at Alta Ski Resort first discovered the secret bliss of deep powder in the 1940s. Located in Salt Lake County Utah, Alta Ski Resort is also known for its deep powder skiing and its reputation for having ""the greatest snow on earth"", Utah's slogan.A fall line when skiing is the diagonal line down the slope at which a skier would obtain the most momentum, due to the force of gravity. Powder skiing and general skiing techniques such as the Alberg technique can be categorized by the fall line."

 Chandramukhi was one of the esteemed courtesans of the kingdom of Vijayanagaram. Famous for her beauty as well as her singing and dancing skills, she becomes a royal court dancer. She was in love with Gunasekaran, a fellow court dancer who loved her equally and the pair performed together in court at times. Chandramukhi leads a normal life before Vettaiyan kills her and Gunasekaran. In her spirit form she becomes a force of blind rage and grief with hostile intentions. However she appears to be patient in her goal and possesses Ganga like a parasite, slowly transferring her personality into the host. Throughout it, her host will merge behaviors with her and replicate how the spirit acted in her lifetime, for example, a trait of Chandramukhi was excessive vanity and obsession with how beautiful she looked. In her fully possessed form, Chandramukhi is a compulsive dancer who enjoys listening to the sound of her voice. She also has a demonic and murderous personality when confronted with whom she believes to be Vettaiyan.	Chandramukhi was one of the esteemed courtesans of the kingdom of Vijayanagaram.

" Clarke Garrison was portrayed from 1987 to 1992 and from 1996 to 2009 by Daniel McVicar. McVicar describes Clarke as ""the classic heel with a heart, a cad with a conscience"". He is a former fashion designer for the now-defunct Spectra Fashions. Originally a student at Otis Parsons Institute the eternally ambitious character has always wrestled with the balance between ambition and questions of the heart. He has two sons, C.J. (Mick Cain) from his marriage to Sally Spectra (played by Darlene Conley), and Mark (Michael Dietz) from his affair with Margo Lynley (Lauren Koslow). He was also once married to Kristen Forrester (then played by Teri Ann Linn). Their relationship began when Kristen's mother, Stephanie (Susan Flannery), hired Clarke to seduce Kristen, fearing that her daughter was frigid. Clarke began to have feelings for Kristen and they married, before splitting later. Clarke left town in September 1992, returning four years later to see his son, C.J. (then played by Kyle Sabihy). C.J. wanted nothing to do with his father, angry at Clarke for walking out on him and Sally. This changed when Clarke rescued him from kidnappers. Clarke and Sally remained close friends; she affectionately called him ""Bucky"". He also shared a bond with Sally's former receptionist, Darla (Schae Harrison), who Sally thought of as a daughter. After a disastrous flirtation with Morgan DeWitt (Sarah Buxton), which almost ended with Clarke being killed by her pet python, ""Patsy"", Clarke began to woo a recently returned Kristen (now Tracy Melchior). His attempts at seducing his ex-wife were unsuccessful, as Kristen moved on with Tony Dominguez (Paulo Benedeti). Clarke's most notable lapse in judgement was in early 2005, when he reluctantly helped a vengeful Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz) trap Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss) and his stepdaughter Bridget Forrester (Ashley Jones) down a mineshaft in the hope that they would give into their ""feelings"" for one another, destroying Ridge's marriage to Bridget's mother, Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang). Amber received the ammunition she needed, and she and Clarke escaped prosecution due to Sally's pleas for Stephanie not to press charges. It seems, however, that the Forresters have forgiven Clarke for this crime, as he is often present at their family gatherings. Until recently Clarke worked at Forrester Creations, as the new head designer, after being hired by the new owners at that time, Nick (Jack Wagner) and Jackie Marone (Lesley-Anne Down). He was demoted to designer after Brooke returned to Forrester Creations and was made head designer. After Eric Forrester (John McCook) bought back Forrester Creations, he was under no obligation to honor Clarke's contract and Clarke was released from the company. Not too long after Jackie Marone and Dominick Marone sold Forrester Creations back to the Forresters, Clarke found himself once again back at Spectra Fashions. Because the new owners of Spectra Fashions had gone bankrupt, the company was reverted to Sally Spectra. As she no longer wanted to run the business, Sally Spectra asked Clarke and their son C.J. to sell the business for her. Knowing Jackie and her son would be interested, Clarke made his way to their home. One thing led to the next and Nick purchased the company making Clarke their head designer. The company was later renamed ""M Fashions"". Clarke worked at Jackie M Designs, the company formerly known as Spectra Fashions."	Clarke Garrison, a former fashion designer who rescued his ex-wife from kidnappers, has died at the age of 74.
 In total, 191 civilians were killed by the clashes and massacres by the two gangs, although the real total is unknown, due to many bodies having not been found. Ten members of Chen Mechan were killed, including the seven by Celestin. Haitian authorities arrested three people, including the leader of the 400 Mawozo-affiliated Baz 222 gang. The police also installed new checkpoints in Plaine du Cul-de-Sac following the clashes. Several weapons were seized as well. In Butte Boyer, every house was searched and then destroyed by Chen Mechan. In other neighborhoods, eighty-one houses in total were destroyed in the fighting. By June 27, 2022, there had been no trials of the three gang members arrested. The Haitian government had also not released a statement by that time. Chen Mechan members were still conducting raids in Plaine du Cul-de-Sac in late June, looking for 400 Mawozo informants. Many of the displaced fled to the Clericine public square, a majority of whom do not want to return.	A series of clashes between two different gangs in different areas of a city.
 In 1954, musician Ike Turner relocated his band the Kings of Rhythm from Clarksdale, Mississippi to St. Louis, Missouri. Turner performed around the greater St. Louis area and built a strong following. In 1957, Ann Bullock joined Turner's band as a vocalist and was called Little Ann. She was later given the stage name Tina Turner and they released their first song as Ike & Tina Turner in 1960. When the single became a hit, they began performing as the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. They embarked on a grueling series of one-nighters throughout the United States on the Chitlin' Circuit. They relocated to Los Angeles, California in 1962. In 1966, the Turners visited England for the first time to join the Rolling Stones on their British Tour. In 1969, they began headlining in Las Vegas, Nevada. They gained further exposure by performing at music festivals and joining the Rolling Stones for select dates on their American Tour. The revue continued to expand its audience by performing in Africa, Asia, and throughout Europe until they disbanded in 1976.	A musician relocated his band relocated his band the first single became hit, they began performing as single hit, they released their first song as hit.
 The building has three levels, developing on a rectangular floor plan 40 m long and 13 m wide. On the east front, it has a columned portico developed on five round arches, placed asymmetrically, with a wooden trussed ceiling. The top floor consists of a loggia extending across the entire surface of the villa, covered by wooden trusses supporting the roof pitches. A cross-vaulted cellar extends only partially over a square portion of the roof. The only vertical connection prior to the 20th century restoration (which saw the introduction of a three-flight internal staircase) was the external staircase in the forepart at the end of the southern façade. Some frescoes preserved inside the ladies' room constitute a very rare example of the depiction of the leisure and occupations of the ladies of the court: they depict moments of the mistress's day, from waking up accompanied by music, to playing chess, to preparing the nuptial bed. They are considered one of the best Lombard fresco cycles of the entire 15th century.	The medieval frescoes of the ladies' room at the Roman Empire's Leicestershire villa have been revealed in a new exhibition.
 According to a sakhi, Guru Hargobind once chastised a Sikh for becoming distracted whilst reciting gurbani. Guru Har Rai, the seventh Guru, emphasized the importance of not even changing a single word of gurbani and taught the correct pronunciation of it. In 1706, after the Battle of Muktsar, the army of Guru Gobind Singh camped at Sabo Ki Talwandi, now known as Takht Sri Damdamā Sahib. For nine months, Guru Gobind Singh, Baba Deep Singh, and Bhai Mani Singh scribed an entire volume of the Guru Granth Sahib in a volume known as the Damdama Bir. During this period, Guru Gobind Singh preformed katha of the entirety of the scripture, as well as teaching the proper recitation, or santhiya. This exact bir (copy) was later given the gurgaddi as the 11th Guru of the Sikhs. That year, Guru Gobind Singh is said to have founded a distinguished school of exegesis, later headed up by Baba Deep Singh. Damdamā Sahib was considered to be the highest seat of learning for the Sikhs during the 18th century, and the Damdami Taksal claims direct historical ties to Guru Gobind Singh, who entrusted it with the responsibility of teaching the reading (santhyā), analysis (vichār) of the Sikh scriptures.

 The Dunstan Mountains form the entrance to the Upper Clutha Valley. The northwest flank of the range is bound by a combination of Cluden Stream in the Lindis Valley, the Lindis River, the Clutha River (Māori: Mata-Au) and Lake Dunstan. Lake Dunstan follows the former Clutha River through the Cromwell Gorge demarcating the southwest limit of the mountains. The mountain range is bound to the east by the Manuherikia Valley and to the northeast by Dunstan Creek, which joins the Manuherikia River at Saint Bathans. The Dunstan Mountains are bisected by the 4-wheel drive Thomson Gorge Road which follows Thomsons Creek, incised into the eastern flank of the range and the Rise and Shine Creek on the western flank. Thomsons Saddle, between the two creeks, climbs to 980 m (3,220 ft) elevation. The summit landscape is generally a broad, gently sloping undulatory surface which climbs steadily from the west and falls sharply to the Manuherakia Valley floor on the east. The asymmetric nature of the Dunstan Mountains is common with most of Central Otago's basin and range mountains.	The Dunstan Mountains are the highest mountain in the Central Otago valleys, which are bound by a combination of rivers and streams.
" Sharma's first ascent of Es Pontàs featured prominantly in the award-winning 2007 climbing film, King Lines, which became an iconic film in rock climbing. Images of Sharma soloing on the dramatic and overhanging arch above deep blue sea, adorned the covers of most climbing magazines, showcasing DWS to the global climbing community. In 2016, Rock & Ice said: ""The silhouette of Sharma on the underside of the Es Pontàs arch is an indelible image for climbers of the mid-2000s"". In a 2016 interview with Climbing, when DWS pioneer Miquel Riera was asked about the most impressive DWS ascent, he replied: ""Have you seen Chris Sharma on Es Pontàs? That should answer your question"". Sharma said of his ascent: ""... definitely a pivotal experience in my life that set me on an entirely new path in my life and in the world"". He also said: ""... deep water soloing embodies for me the perfect form of climbing. Take Es Pontàs for instance, it’s a route I put up in Mallorca. It's 5.15, but I can solo it. For me, that's as good as it gets"". Climbing considered his ascent of Es Pontàs as being another example of Sharma's talent for ""... the genius to see the potential, coupled with the commitment to spend months and years of his life proving it"". Climbing also noted that the ascent, and increased profile Sharma brought to DWS, as being another example of his influence on the development of the sport of modern rock climbing, saying: ""Sharma shaped modern rock climbing. Whatever he thought was cool, we followed. Bouldering. Projecting hard sport routes. Deep water soloing""."	Chris Sharma's ascent of the Spanish island of Es Pontàs has been named as the most impressive rock climbing experience in the world.
 For more than half a century, Zhang made her home in Xi’an, Shaan’xi Province. Her works focus on the unity and harmonious relationship between science and aesthetics, as well as between vernacular and modern. In the 1970s, she undertook the restoration of building structures and gardens of the Tang dynasty. Her ideas on utilising technological and scientific advancements were realised in her conservation and heritage projects, most notably the Shaanxi History Museum. The project is described as a modern architectural project by which traditional architectural elements are used as ingredients of innovation. Beyond revitalising the ancient city and its history, Zhang’s designs present architecture features of the past in the modern context. This approach, often referred as the “Neo-Tang Style”, gained popularity through her works.	A renowned Chinese architect, Zhang Zhao, has died at the age of 99. She is one of the world’s most famous architects.
" The NMS will utilise cell broadcast technology, which allows messages to be broadcast directly from a radio cell tower to all devices in the vicinity, rather than disseminating alerts through text messages to devices in a specified location as with the current Emergency Alert system. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) says the technology will allow for ""near real-time"", simultaneous messaging to all devices in a specified area and is unconstrained by telecommunications network congestion, a problem which arose with the current system. Messages would have a character limit of 1395 characters, and would be able to have a priority level specified that would differentiate the way messages are displayed on receiving devices. Devices receiving alerts under the new system would display an on-screen message that cannot be easily dismissed. The technology would allow for multilingual messaging, but it is not clear yet how this functionality would be utilised by the NMS and what languages messages would be offered in. Location targeting under the new system would allow an area as small as a one-kilometre radius to be defined, and would also enable messages to be sent to individual local government areas (LGAs). == References =="	The National Emergency Management Service (NMS) has announced plans to introduce a new emergency messaging system for remote areas.
 This dish lends itself to many variations and is sometimes confused with Syracuse sauce (because of the presence of anchovies), the original recipe of which, however, often uses short pasta and does not involve the use of breadcrumbs, but rather a generous amount of vegetables, capers and olives; these are foods that are not present in the traditional recipe of this dish, with the rare exception of olives, which are black. It should also not be confused with the first course, especially in Palermo, called pasta with sardines: although tradition says it was born in the Syracuse area (but by cooks of the Arab army, camped there to conquer the city), it is quite distant from the culinary customs of the Syracuse area, considering ingredients such as raisins and pine nuts (a classic combination of Palermo cuisine), as well as saffron, and the fish that dominates the dish is sardine, not anchovy. The toasted breadcrumbs in the original pasta with sardines are not present.	Palermo pasta with anchovy sauce is one of the most popular dishes in the Italian capital, Palermo, but it is not the only one.
 William Bentall, a farmer who lived in Goldhanger, invented some time between 1760 and 1790 the Goldhanger plough (also known as the Essex plough), which was put on the market in 1797. In 1805, William Bentall formed a company to manufacture agricultural equipment sited on the south bank of the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation. In 1814, William's son Edward Hammond Bentall was born. Edward joined the firm at 22 in 1836, and by 1839 he had incorporated it as E.H. Bentall & Co., and in 1841 patented an improved version of his father's Goldhanger Plow. In 1851, Edward's 1843 patented design for the Broad Share Cultivator won the company the gold medal at the Great Exhibition, with a further three first prizes at the Royal Agricultural Society Show in 1859. Other patented inventions by Edward included the improved oil cake mill and the prize root pulper, which both won first prize at the Royal Society meet at Chester in 1858. With these successes Bentall's reputation grew and orders were coming in from all over the world. During the mid-1800s Bentall's started building housing for their staff. By 1889 Edward's son, Edmund Ernest Bentall had started to run the business.	The founder of a plough in Essex has died at the age of 91, according to the company's chief executive.
" The story was one of several Crisis stories to be rapidly repackaged as a graphic novel, an unusual step for British comics of the time. Rian Hughes, art director for Crisis, handled the design, which included a new cover commissioned from Pleece and a foreword by Grant Morrison. At this stage the story began attracting negative attention from Christian groups, and The Sunday Times ran an interview with Dave Roberts (then-editor of Christian magazine Alpha), describing it as ""an incitement to religious hatred"" and comparing it to Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses as an example of blasphemy. Fleetway's managing director John Davidge, who had controversially blocked Crisis from publishing Peter Milligan and Brendan McCarthy's ""Skin"", ordered the collected edition withdrawn after a short period on sale; a press release stated this was due to the story being ""inappropriate"" for the book market. Purportedly Davidge made the decision on the direct order of Fleetway owner Robert Maxwell. The print run - variously reported as being 5,000 or 20,000 copies - was destroyed. The Economist ran an article on the controversy on 19 January 1991, speculating that ""no one would think twice about it"" if the story was a novel, and felt that the furore was largely caused by the ongoing belief in the press that the comic medium was still exclusively aimed at children. New Statesman also discussed the controversy, quoting a BBC Radio 4 interview where Ennis reiterated his opposition to organised religion. In 1997 DC's mature readers Vertigo Comics label, for whom Ennis was writing Preacher at the time, released a new collected edition with a fresh cover by Pleece and a ne foreword by Ennis himself."

" Japanese scholars have indicated that Yamato no Aya clan and other ""Aya (漢)"" clans were all related and that they were generally classified under the same ethnic group. These mainly included: ""Aya clan (漢氏)"", ""Yamato no Aya clan (東漢氏/倭漢氏)"" and the ""Kawachi no Aya clan (西漢氏/河内漢氏)"". It is said that Yamato no Aya, Aya and Kawachi no Aya, though not from the same founder, were genetically related. ""Kawachi no Aya (西漢氏)"" is thought to be related with the Yamato no Aya clan. Kawachi no Aya clan was one of the clans first founded by the scholar Wani (alongside clans such as ""Kawachi no Fumi clan (西文氏)"") who arrived in Japan from the kingdom of Baekje who spread the use of the Chinese Writing system in Japan. After the formation of the clans, the next immigrants were mainly called ""Imaki no Ayahito (今来漢人/新漢人)"". Yamato no Aya clan also had a related clan called the ""Sakanoue clan (坂上氏)"" (same clan of Sakanoue no Karitamaro, the warrior of Korean descent) which was once part of the bigger and more influential Yamato no Aya clan, but later broke off to form a clan of their own."	The Yamato no Aya clan has been named as one of the largest ethnic groups in Japan, according to a new study.

" The term ""Karma Yoga"" is derived from two Sanskrit words: ""Karma"" and ""Yoga."" In Sanskrit, ""Karma"" means action or deed. It refers to the actions or activities performed by an individual, including their thoughts, words, and physical actions. ""Yoga"" means union or connection. It signifies the process of uniting the individual self (atman) with the universal consciousness or the Divine (Brahman). When combined, ""Karma Yoga"" can be understood as the path of selfless action, where an individual performs their duties and responsibilities without attachment to the results, aiming to attain spiritual growth and union with the Divine. It emphasizes the importance of performing actions as a service or offering to the Divine, without seeking personal gains or rewards."	"""Karma Yoga"" is a traditional yoga practice which aims to promote spiritual growth and union with the divine."
" Angela of Metal.de compared 10 Year Anniversary: Live in Reykjavík to Skáldöld's previous live album, Skálmöld & Sinfóníuhljómsveit Íslands (2013), which was recorded with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra, and said the new album displays the band ""at its purest"". She said it reflects the experience of Skálmöld's regular concerts, with the audience singing along in Icelandic throughout the songs, a unique feature of shows in the band's home country.

 Incorporating elements of animation, sculpture, and sound, Nathalie Djurberg and Hans Berg construct scenarios rich in psychological tension, exploring both human and primal desires. Djurberg, since 2001, has cultivated a unique filmmaking style marked by clay animation, through which she articulates fundamental instincts such as jealousy, vengeance, avarice, submission, and lust. Since 2004, Djurberg has been working as an artistic duo with her collaborator, musician and composer Hans Berg, complementing Djurberg's animations and installations with his atmospheric sound effects and entrancing musical scores. Djurberg and Berg frequently construct mentally disconcerting environments in their films and sculptural installations. Their main characters, often depicted as girls or young women, are described by The New York Times as engaging in a spectrum of malevolent activities. These range from mild deceit and amicable torture, to curiously innocuous bestiality, and at the extreme, murder and chaos. == References ==	Award-winning filmmaker Nathalie Djurberg and composer Hans Berg are best known for their surrealist films, installations, and sculptures.

 In 2016, Garcia founded the party called Prodinculous/Procitizen advocating for the protection of entrepreneurial freedom and the preservation of individuals' rights to private ownership. Garcias has voiced his belief as the surveys indicate that Venezuelans are in favor of Free Enterprise, economic freedom, dialogue, and women's rights. He was disqualified from running for the mayor of Caracas, a decision he publicly denounced. In 2019, he traveled to the United States and met with Mauriceo Clever and various officials in the Donald Trump administration. During this time, he emphasized the need for a unity government between the opposition and the Chavista government as the solution for Venezuela's political problems. Ten deputies who were previously members of the parliamentary block of the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) in the National Assembly (AN) from Un Nuevo Tiempo and other parties resigned from their parties and joined García's political movement.

 Monika Fleischmann trained as a fashion designer in Zurich before working in radio and studying Visual Arts/Theater Pedagogy at the Berlin University of the Arts. Wolfgang Strauss began his career as a carpenter and later studied architecture at the Berlin University of the Arts. They began their artistic journey in West Berlin in the 1980s, when the boundaries between reality and virtuality were beginning to blur. Inspired by the vibrant and dynamic atmosphere of the city as a hub of subcultures and artistic impulses, they set out to explore the interfaces between art, technology and society. Their early projects spanned multiple media, including architecture, urban space, photographic novels, collages, and audiovisual installations. During their first experiments with digital media, they found that their ideas can only be realized if art and computer science work together.	A multi-faceted artist and architect, Fleischmann divides his time between his artistic and architectural roles.
 Hiddensee is the largest island of the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park and combines an old cultural landscape with the heaths of the originally existing dune heath. The large new land formations in the northeast (Alter and Neuer Bessin) and south (am Gellen) of Hiddensee provide habitats for numerous invertebrates, such as worms and mussels. These then serve as food for many migratory birds. Thus, the island environment is one of the most important crane resting places in Germany. The southern tip of the island as well as the New Bessin have therefore been assigned to protection zone I of the National Park Vorpommersche Boddenlandschaft and may not be entered. There are two nature reserves on the island, the NSG Dünenheide between Neuendorf and Vitte and the NSG Dornbusch and Schwedenhagener Ufer in the north. The Hiddenseer Dünenheide is the largest coastal dune heath preserved in context in the German Baltic Sea region.In 1924, wild rabbits were released at the Dornbusch to enrich the hunt, which turned out to be a serious mistake. After only a few years, the animals had proliferated extraordinarily and the damage caused by game is still considerable today. In 1962, deer were also released on the island. Wild boars regularly come to the island from Rügen. In the mid-seventies, an elk was also sighted. Wood lizards, adders and grass snakes are also found on the island. The Naturschutzgesellschaft Hiddensee und Boddenlandschaft maintains a permanent exhibition on fauna and flora in Vitte in the national park house. From 1936 until around 2018, the Hiddensee ornithological station worked on the island, since then there is no longer an observation station here.

The second edition of the competition is scheduled to be held on 4 2023.
 Belarusian Hajun was created in early January 2022 as a monitoring initiative to track movements of Russian military equipment and troops on the territory of Belarus. The project had the task of monitoring the amount of equipment transported into the country and withdrawn, and where a new Russian military base could potentially emerge. The project was created so that Belarusians would understand what was happening on the territory of Belarus. On February 20, 2022, the Telegram channel of Hajun was created, in which the team began publishing information about detected Russian troops and their movements. For the first two months of the war, the team had to work 24/7. In February and March, an average of 1500 people a day wrote to the project. At the peak, this figure reached up to 2000 people. In March 2022, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus recognized the project's Telegram channel as an extremist formation. In April 2022, more than 360 thousand people subscribed to the channel. At that time, 90% were subscribers from Ukraine, and the rest were Belarusians. As of February 25, 2023, more than half a million people were subscribed to the project's Telegram channel.	A project created in Belarus during the first two months of World War Two has been broadcast on the Telegram channel. The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different projects from around the world.

 Of the monetary units that are included in the ISO 4217 standard and exist in cash, only the Panamanian balboa is not issued in the form of banknotes - the local population in Panama uses balboa coins and US dollar banknotes. Also, in real money circulation, there are some other monetary units only in the form of coins. This is due to the spread of a parallel currency in the relevant territory: Tuvaluan dollar and Kiribati dollar - Australian dollar banknotes are used; Pitcairn Islands dollar - banknotes of the New Zealand dollar are used; Timorese and Ecuadorian centavo - US dollar banknotes are used; in Madagascar, coins of the Malagasy franc remain in circulation, while banknotes and coins of the Malagasy ariary are mainly used.

" It was established on 4 July 2022, with the purpose of expressing opposition to the French presence in Operation Barkhane, which the group perceives as a ""French military presence in Niger""; the group views it as a form of invasion. During these protests, participants used the flags of Russia and Niger as symbols. Protests continued as of 19 September 2022, and certain slogans emerged, such as ""France is a Nazi State! "", ""The colonial army (Barkhane) must leave"", and ""Pull the French colonial army out"". Many protesters also wore shirts depicting the Z symbol used during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The leader of M62, Abdoulaye Seydou, has denied any links with the Russian government, stating that ""We are fighting for Niger's sovereignty, so we are not with any foreign country partners"", and said protest organizers confiscated Russian flags brought by protesters. In an interview with The Irish Times, he described Thomas Sankara as an ""idol"" for his opposition to neocolonialism. Seydou was arrested by the government of Mohamed Bazoum just one day after the interview. During the 2023 Nigerien coup d'état against Bazoum, the group marched in support of the coup. In a march at the request of Abdourahmane Tchiani, thousands of pro-coup Nigeriens gathered in Niamey's Concertation Square, in front of the National Assembly, and went to the French embassy carrying Nigerien and Russian flags, with slogans such as ""Down with France, out with Barkhane, we don't care about ECOWAS, the European Union and the African Union! "", ""Arrest the former dignitaries to return the stolen millions"", and ""Down with France, long live Putin!"" The demonstrators also called for an immediate intervention by the Russian paramilitary Wagner Group. During the march, the entrances to the French and American embassies were closed. The French embassy's walls and gates were set ablaze and damaged whilst Nigerien soldiers and General Salifou Modi were seen on the ground urging the crowds to disperse peacefully. == References =="	M62, also known as M62, is a pro-Russian protest group based in the Nigerien capital, Niamey, which was founded in 2022.
 Players of John Company will consider some of the issues that affected the historical EIC between 1710 and the 1860s. For instance, players must decide whether or not to try and conquer the Indian kingdoms; if they do, they may install a Governor-General, and traffic the opium they control to China. Players may hire Indians to assist them; these include Sikhs, the Jagat Seth family, Awadh, Arcot, Orissa, the Nizam of Hyderabad, and a Rajput prince. Meanwhile, Indians may revolt against the Company; in the real world, this led to the EIC's downfall, due to the Indian Revolt of 1857. The exact setup rules depend on the scenario the players choose, reflecting the historical fortunes of India and the EIC. For the 1710 or long 1710 scenarios, the Company has no debt, weak armies, and no ships. If the game starts in 1758, the Calico Acts will already have been passed, there is a governor in Bengal, the Company is already in debt, and Mysore and Bombay are stronger than in 1710. For an 1813 scenario, the Company has larger armies and more ships, while Bombay is weaker but the Punjab stronger. The laws players consider voting on also reflect historical fact. One card in the deck represents the Calico Acts; historically, these banned imports of cotton (as the EIC had been doing) and helped the rise and industrialization of the British cotton industry. If passed, the game card simulates this by reducing Company profits and allowing players to buy extra workshops while rewarding those who already have them; it also has support in Parliament, which reflects how MPs represented local economies dependent on textiles, while the rents of many Lords were connected to the wool industry. The Writer Privileges law, on the other hand, has less support in Parliament, but allows the players to gain extra money from trading in India, and makes future votes to deregulate the Company easier; a historical note on the card explains that reducing restrictions led to cheaper prices for Indian goods in Britain, which led to more support for deregulation. Players may also debate whether to recruit sepoys (Indian soldiers), extend the franchise (reducing the value of rotten boroughs and making it more expensive to buy votes), or provide relief for famines in India. These reflect issues Britain and the EIC faced in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the Reform Act 1832, Chartism, and several famines which affected India. One of the game's topics is the relationship between the EIC's actions in India and British culture then and now, and how reliant Britain was on its empire. For example, if the Company is successful, players will have more money and votes with which to influence Parliament; but whether it is or not, its violent actions will inevitably affect on its own culture.	John Company is a game that allows players to decide whether or not to leave the British Empire (EIC) in India.

 For a number of years there had been a disagreement in Scottish athletics over whether professional cycle racing events should be allowed at amateur athletics meetings. There were strong views both in favour and against the position, and arriving at a deadlock in their negotiations several western district clubs in favour of allowing professional cycle events, led by Clydesdale Harriers, seceded from the SAAA and formed the Scottish Amateur Athletics Union (SAAU). The consequence of this was that there were two national championships in both 1895 and 1896 held under the auspices of the two separate bodies. In both years the two championships were held on the same day, with the SAAA adhering to their policy of alternating between an Eastern and a Western venue, while the SAAU held their championship at Hampden Park, Glasgow on both occasions. == References ==	There was a disagreement in Scottish athletics over whether professional cycle racing events should be allowed at amateur athletics meetings .

" The game consists of four quadrants: four players choose their own squares; begins with the 4th square diagonally serving to the 2nd square; the 2nd then returns the ball with one hit to any square to start the rally. When the ball lands in a player’s square they are eliminated, and the player in the 4th square always scores a point but only if the player in the 4th square is not eliminated (otherwise, no points are received by any); the remaining three players all rotate clockwise, and the eliminated player keeps their points but goes back to the 1st square OR is replaced by a new player in the 1st square. The game is played to 11 points (win by 2). A player is eliminated when: the ball lands on the ground inside their own square; player returns the ball out of bounds; failing to hit the ball into another square; double hitting the ball; hitting the ball incorrectly; or hitting the ball out of turn. The ball is considered in play when the ball lands on the outside boundary. Players are not allowed to catch, hold, or carry the ball at any point during play. Players are required to hit the ball with their ""hands"", which is any section between the fingertips and wrists, including the back of the hands."	A game consisting of four quadrants.
 Alongwith many classic shloka from Bhagvad Gita, the following shloka has a great significance:- Following is the English translation of the shloka:- O Arjuna! You have the right to perform your own duty! But you should not be concerned about it's outcomes. Never be motivated by the results of your actions, nor should you be attached to not performing your prescribed duties. The shloka was widely used in India. It was the introductory theme song of BR Chopra's B.R. Films. The shloka was used in S.S. Rajamouli's 2022- Telugu Movie RRR, by Ram Charan. Furthermore, the shloka was widely used at different times and by many politicians in India. Prominent Indian Independence Movement leader, Mahatma Gandhi's interpretation of the Sankhya Yoga chapter in the Bhagavad Gita revolved around selfless action, non-attachment, and the concept of duty. He believed that individuals should focus on performing their responsibilities without being attached to the results. This philosophy guided his approach to nonviolent resistance, where actions were taken with sincerity and without the desire for personal gain. The Mahatma Gandhi emphasized the importance of self-discipline and renunciation of material desires, aligning with the Gita's teachings on detachment. His legacy in Sankhya Yoga lies in his application of these principles to social and political activism, advocating for justice, equality, and freedom through peaceful means. This interpretation continues to inspire individuals globally to engage in selfless service and contribute to positive societal change.	The shloka was the introductory theme song of BR Chopra's B.R.

 As early as 1911, the game was being played regularly at Oxford with records of the university's Australian rules football club's foundation dating to 1906. The Cambridge University Australian Rules Football Club is believed to have been founded around 1911. In 1911 Oxford University captained by Alfred Clemens defeated Cambridge University captained by Ron Larking 13.9 (87) to 5.12 (42). In 1914, H C A Harrison reported that the game was being played regularly at both Oxford and Cambridge universities though few records exist of contests between 1911 and 1921. After the war, in 1921, the Oxford University–Cambridge University Varsity match between expatriate Australian students became an annual contest. The 90th Varsity match was the subject of a short ABC documentary (Video on YouTube).	The 90th Varsity match between Oxford University and Cambridge University has been marked by the Australian rules football club's foundation.
" Compared to Southeastern China, the Dongbei or Northeast region of China was settled by Han Chinese relatively recently, only in the past 200 years or so, during a migration movement referred to as Chuang Guandong. Jia Xingjia, a Chinese essayist, compared this expansion to the Western Expansion of the United States, in which the Northeast was seen by China as a sort of cultural blank slate. Many of these migrants abandoned their hometowns and left behind their folk traditions and languages. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Northeast was an industrial hotbed of China. State-owned industrial operations guaranteed lifetime employment to blue-collar workers, the ""iron rice bowl."" During this time, it was the most urbanized area of China, and boasted the country's most extensive rail network. Communities were organized around factories which provided not just employment, but also a community to their workers, such as in state-owned cultural palaces, which could serve as movie theaters, libraries, chess rooms, and stadiums, among other roles. These palaces and their decline are a common element of Dongbei renaissance works, and could be seen as a communist analogue to the capitalist dead mall: a once-vibrant physical community center that has become outmoded with economic decline and the rise of Internet-based communities. Economic reforms in 1990s China led to privately-owned businesses outcompeting state enterprises. Corruption and increased competition caused state-owned manufacturing plants to decline, and their employees were laid off en masse. The resulting economic depression in these areas created urban decay. The northeast, more so than other regions, was both economically and culturally enmeshed with the Communist state. As a result, it struggled to adapt to a liberalized China."	In the past these abandoned their hometowns and left behind left behind their folk traditions and languages.
 The watershed of what is just called the Winter brook encompasses entirely the watershed of the Winter brook, Big brook, Black Water, and Hulpe. The source area of the Winter brook is in Korspel, a hamlet of Beringen. In the downstream direction to the west, three streams combine to contribute to the flow of the Winter brook, among them the Genemeer brook. As a result of mine subsidence, the water management in this source area was disturbed, leading to the reversal of the flow direction of the Genemeer brook, which ceased to join the Winter brook. As a result, a new connection was established from the source area of this stream to Winter brook. Between the villages of Beverlo and Beringen Mine, the brook flows westward, guided through a siphon under the Albert Canal. It now continues southwestward, passing to the north of the Paalse Lake and southeast of Tessenderlo and Deurne. Until this stage, it falls within the classification as a second-class non-navigable watercourse. Near the Paalse Lake, it becomes a watercourse of the first category due to high pollution. Further downstream, Small brook and Middle brook (Dutch:Middelbeek) run parallel to the Winter brook, and the name changes to Big brook. The valley with these parallel running streams is known as the Valley of the Three Brooks. The brook flows south of Deurne, along the area of Asdonk. When the Small brook merges into the Big brook, the name changes to Black Water. This name is given to the dark color that the water acquires due to the presence of peat soil. Beyond Molenstede, there is another name change, and the brook becomes the Hulpe, named after a significant side stream that joins it. Under the name Hulpe, it flows through the Demer Marshes before finally joining the Demer River. In the western part of the watershed, the valley is flanked by escarpments composed of iron sandstone. These escarpments are up to 30 meters higher than their surroundings.	The Winter brook is one of several streams that contribute to the flow of the Winter Brook . It flows through the Demer Marshes and passes through a siphon under the Albert Canal . When the Small brook merges into the Big brook, the name changes to Black Water .

 The Fifth Circuit analyzed whether Bitcoin transaction records are protected by the Fourth Amendment. The court likened Bitcoin transactions to bank records, which are not protected by the Fourth Amendment under the third-party doctrine. This doctrine holds that a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties. The court ruled that Gratkowski voluntarily disclosed information about his Bitcoin transactions to third parties (i.e., all users globally of the Bitcoin network and Coinbase), and therefore he had no reasonable expectation of privacy in this information. Affirming the district court's denial of Gratkowski's motion to suppress the evidence, the court ruled that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in Bitcoin transaction records on the blockchain or held by a third-party exchange like Coinbase, thus such records are not protected by the Fourth Amendment. The case was decided by a panel consisting of Circuit Judges Carl E. Stewart, James L. Dennis, and Catharina Haynes, with Judge Haynes delivering the opinion of the court.	The Circuit Court has rejected a High Court ruling that Bitcoin trader Markus gratkowski had no reasonable expectation of privacy.
" Japanese scholars have indicated that Yamato no Aya clan and other ""Aya (漢)"" clans were all related and that they were generally classified under the same ethnic group. These mainly included: ""Aya clan (漢氏)"", ""Yamato no Aya clan (東漢氏/倭漢氏)"" and the ""Kawachi no Aya clan (西漢氏/河内漢氏)"". It is said that Yamato no Aya, Aya and Kawachi no Aya, though not from the same founder, were genetically related. ""Kawachi no Aya (西漢氏)"" is thought to be related with the Yamato no Aya clan. Kawachi no Aya clan was one of the clans first founded by the scholar Wani (alongside clans such as ""Kawachi no Fumi clan (西文氏)"") who arrived in Japan from the kingdom of Baekje who spread the use of the Chinese Writing system in Japan. After the formation of the clans, the next immigrants were mainly called ""Imaki no Ayahito (今来漢人/新漢人)"". Yamato no Aya clan also had a related clan called the ""Sakanoue clan (坂上氏)"" (same clan of Sakanoue no Karitamaro, the warrior of Korean descent) which was once part of the bigger and more influential Yamato no Aya clan, but later broke off to form a clan of their own."	The Yamato no Aya clan (東漢氏) is thought to have been one of the first clans to arrive in Japan from Korea.
 The minority stress model takes into account significant stressors that distinctly affect the mental health of those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or another non-conforming gender identity. Some risk factors that contribute to declining mental health are heteronormativity, discrimination, harassment, rejection (e.g., family rejection and social exclusion), stigma, prejudice, denial of civil and human rights, lack of access to mental health resources, lack of access to gender-affirming spaces (e.g., gender-appropriate facilities), and internalized homophobia. The structural circumstance where a non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming individual is embedded in significantly affects the potential sources of risk. The compounding of these everyday stressors increase poor mental health outcomes among individuals in the LGBT community. Evidence shows that there is a direct association between LGBT individuals' development of severe mental illnesses and the exposure to discrimination.In addition, there are a lack of access to mental health resources specific to LGBT individuals and a lack of awareness about mental health conditions within the LGBT community that restricts patients from seeking help.

 The NWA covers an area of 23.7 ha, including 1.46 ha in the marine environment. It is located five kilometers east of downtown Rimouski, and its territory lies entirely within the city of Rimouski, in the Pointe-au-Père sector.The Sainte-Anne River flows through the reserve from east to west. A large part of the reserve is a spartina marsh with several mudflats. The latter is protected from the St. Lawrence River by a rocky headland. The reserve's bedrock is part of the Trois-Pistoles formation. Much of the marsh is flooded during spring and autumn-spring tides. This Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician formation is composed of sandstone, conglomerate, siltstone and slate.	The National National Park (NWA) is one of the world's largest nature reserves, according to the National Geographic Agency.

 Digging of the shaft began on June 1, 1854, 835 metres from the Saint-Charles shaft, with a section measuring 5.1 metres by 2.5 metres. By September 1856, it had reached a depth of 93.60 metres. The water was drained (20 m3 per hour) using a ten-horsepower steam engine consisting of a horizontal cylinder and gears. This engine was used to drive the pumps and raise the skips of excavated material, while a horse-drawn engine was used to lower the equipment and carry out various manoeuvres. A casing was installed in the rectangular section. At 25.70 metres, the shaft was circular in cross-section and 3.20 metres in diameter. In September 1856, a 12-horsepower direct-drive steam engine accompanied by pumps was ordered from Le Creusot for dewatering; this equipment was operational in June 1857 and sinking resumed. The dewatering machine operated at a rate of seven or eight strokes per minute, but was capable of twelve strokes per minute if necessary. The water was pumped up through sheet metal pipes 24 centimetres in diameter.In May 1858, the installation of the dodecagonal casing, made up of sides 94 centimetres wide and a total height of 98.50 metres, was completed. However, the casing was fragile and eventually began to leak, so a small pump driven by a four-horsepower steam engine was installed 104 metres above the surface in June 1873. It collected between 100 and 120 m3 of water a day in a cofferdam.	The Saint-Charles shaft is one of the oldest in the world, dating back to the 19th Century, when it was built to drain water from the River Seine in Paris.

The contest's second edition will be held on 4 November 2023, beginning at 20:30 CET (19:30 UTC) Unlike the 1995 edition, the show will be broadcast on television by all participating broadcasters .
 Monika Fleischmann trained as a fashion designer in Zurich before working in radio and studying Visual Arts/Theater Pedagogy at the Berlin University of the Arts. Wolfgang Strauss began his career as a carpenter and later studied architecture at the Berlin University of the Arts. They began their artistic journey in West Berlin in the 1980s, when the boundaries between reality and virtuality were beginning to blur. Inspired by the vibrant and dynamic atmosphere of the city as a hub of subcultures and artistic impulses, they set out to explore the interfaces between art, technology and society. Their early projects spanned multiple media, including architecture, urban space, photographic novels, collages, and audiovisual installations. During their first experiments with digital media, they found that their ideas can only be realized if art and computer science work together.	Two artists who inspired the digital world have gone on their way to the streets of Berlin in the 1970s and 80s.
" Chris Sims praised the graphic novel while writing for ComicsAlliance; he admitted to initial concern that either the false comic strip or the metafictional history would overshadow the other but found they meshed perfectly, surmising that Goldtiger was ""a book that's more than the sum of its parts. It manages to be a thrilling throwback adventure, a meta-commentary, and the story of two damaged, incompatible creators all at once, and despite my initial misgivings, it's impossible to separate all of those stories out from each other"". Ian Keogh also lauded Goldtiger, calling it ""a very clever and stylish pastiche"", also noting how well the strips and purported production material complemented each other."	The creators of Goldtiger have been given a mixed reception at the Edinburgh Book Festival, where they gathered for the first time.
 As early as 1911, the game was being played regularly at Oxford with records of the university's Australian rules football club's foundation dating to 1906. The Cambridge University Australian Rules Football Club is believed to have been founded around 1911. In 1911 Oxford University captained by Alfred Clemens defeated Cambridge University captained by Ron Larking 13.9 (87) to 5.12 (42). In 1914, H C A Harrison reported that the game was being played regularly at both Oxford and Cambridge universities though few records exist of contests between 1911 and 1921. After the war, in 1921, the Oxford University–Cambridge University Varsity match between expatriate Australian students became an annual contest. The 90th Varsity match was the subject of a short ABC documentary (Video on YouTube).

He worked in numerous offices during this period, contributing to many recognized projects with Dan Rowen Architects, Voorsanger & Associates, Morris Sato Studio, and Leslie Gill Architect. Following his Van Alen Prize in Public Architecture awarded project Tidal Landscapes, in collaboration with the American architect Mike Jacobs, Neubert co-founded the influential, yet short-lived design studio orenj. Neubert moved to Los Angeles, California in 2000 and became a professor at Cal Poly Pomona and Woodbury University. He has taught design at various institutions, including The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, The Southern California Institute of Architecture, Otis School of Design, and the University of Southern California, where he is currently an Adjunct Associate Professor. He has also given lectures on his work in different cities, such as Denmark, Ft. Lauderdale, Miami, New York, and Los Angeles. In 2006, Neubert founded Aaron Neubert Architects [ANX] in Los Angeles, California. Neubert is a California and Nevada licensed architect, NCARB certified, and a former member of the Board of Directors of the L.A. Forum for Architecture and Urban Design. Examples of his work include the T-Street Headquarters, the Light Box Offices, the restaurant OZU, the Metric Hotel, and the Arroyo Oak House.	Aaron Neubert, one of the world's best-known architects, has died at the age of 85. He is a professor at Cal Poly Pomona and Woodbury University.
" The show had a mixed critical reception, with the acting being praised, but the plotting criticised. In a four-star review of the first four episodes, The Guardian's Luke Buckmaster said that it took him time to ""get accustomed to The Messenger's idiosyncratic rhythms, but soon I relished returning to this world"", noting a ""strange alchemy between setting and character"", with ""lean and uncluttered"" plotting. He praised the directors and screenwriters for ""deftly balanc[ing] comedy and drama, creating a subtle and strange quirkiness"", and for ""trust[ing] in the nature and strength of the story and the cast, allowing scenes to breathe while keeping things progressing at a good pace"", as well as the efforts by the programme's cinematographer to ensure ""retro flavour is baked into the show's aesthetic"". TV Tonight's David Knox, in a three-and-a-half star review of the first two episodes, said the series ""effectively asks you to leave your logic at the door and go with its heightened mix of drama, dark comedy and magic realism"", praising McKenna as a ""likeable lead"", and that the series impressed upon him an attempt by ABC to appeal to younger viewers, doubtful it ""will connect with core ABC viewers, and perhaps it might be best framed as premium YA content"". Mel Campbell, for ScreenHub, was more critical. In a two-and-a-half star review of the first four episodes, she opined that the series ""often seems to deliberately withhold sense-making from the audience in pursuit of its air of mystery"", and found the series flipping between what she saw as ""realist drama or magical realism"", and inconsistent motivations of the characters, as exasperating, yet nevertheless said ""the cast do their best with this flawed material""."	The Messenger, an Australian drama series starring McKenna, has been commissioned for a second series by the country's national broadcaster, ABC, which is set in the 1970s.
" As a result, in September 1986 the family-owned Nattermann company was sold to the French chemical and pharmaceutical group Rhône-Poulenc. In December 1999, the latter merged with Hoechst AG to form a new company called Aventis, which in turn was acquired by Sanofi in December 2004. Since then, Nattermann has belonged to Sanofi. Under the direction of Sanofi, Nattermannallee today employs 440 people producing 100 million packages of medicines annually. Nattermann manufactures around 15% of its products for the German market, 85% are exported worldwide, especially to France.The administrative building was transferred to the biotechnology park ""BioCampus Cologne"" in April 2002, where Nattermann continues to be headquartered. The former headquarters was renovated until January 2006. == References =="	Nattermannallee, the headquarters of the German pharmaceutical company Nattermann AG, was the first in Germany to be taken over by a foreign company.
 The site was split in two by the modern road. The buildings were placed around a large central peristyle (courtyard) garden. The residential part (pars urbana) of the villa with a grand facade overlooking the sea is on the eastern side. On the western side of the peristyle (and the modern road) is a richly decorated large private double bath complex. The monumental baths are as big as many ancient public baths, but their richness and magnificence of decoration are more consistent with private baths in this location. Their external appearance would also have been impressive as the roofs were vaulted and domed. The two independent bath suites is a feature of other 4th century villas and may have been influenced by Christianity, which banned mixed bathing and promoted modesty among the newly converted. Other possible parts such as the pars rustica (for servants and other workers) and the pars fructaria (for the processing of products) typical of a Roman villa have not yet been found.

 After the period of Arab rule in Armenia and the South Caucasus, a new period of cultural flourishing began, and active church building was accompanied by new sculptural compositions and solutions. The “first signs” were khachkars (crossstones), which partially continued the tradition of four-sided stelae, forming an original compositional and iconographic system. The period of great and small kingdoms in Armenia, the 9th-11th centuries, was characterized by the formation of several large cultural centers and artistic styles: in Shirak (Shirakavan, Argina, Kars, Ani), Tayk (Ishkhan, Banak, Chordvan, Khakhu), Vaspurakan (Aghtamar), Syunik (Tatev, Bgheno-Noravank). In 915-921 by the order of Gagik Artsruni, the Armenian king of Vaspurakan, one of the unique Armenian monuments, the Church of the Holy Cross on the Aghtamar island was built. The peculiarity of the building was the modest size of the church, the facades of which the architect Manuel managed to decorate with an unprecedented number of sculptures and extensive scenes. The animal types in reliefs are also unprecedented, including fabulous ones. Alternating each other uninterrupted rows of scenes and images of the Aghtamar church seem to be the visual embodiments of the Holy Bible. The monumental images of King Gagik and the deified ancestors of the Artsruni family also found their place in this “Heavenly World”. The 9th-11th centuries Armenian sculpture is rich in images of patrons. On the tympanum of the main entrance of the church of Yerznka (near Ani) (895) were depicted two princes on horseback before the Virgin and Child and accompanied by angels (destroid). In the second half of the 10th century, the high relief figures of the crowned princes Gurgen and Smbat Bagratuni were depicted on the eastern facades of the main churches of Sanahin and Haghpat monasteries (St. Amenaprkich church 966, St. Nshan church 976). And the representatives of the younger branch of Bagratuni (in Tayk), Bagrat and David, were solemnly depicted in Oshkvank (963-973). The compositions of Aghtamar and Oshkvank had direct iconographic correlation to Byzantine imperial images (the mosaic of Constantine and Justinian, St. Sophia, end of the 10th century). And the almost round sculpture of Smbat Bagratuni in Haghpat got its further development in the two-meter statue of King Gagik of Ani, which once decorated the façade of the church of St. Grigor- Gagkashen (1001-1020, architect Trdat). A group of frontal sculptural faces are pre-their unique decorations. That composition consisted of blind arcades extending along the facades of the church and a sculptured “belt” of the Heavenly Garden inhabited by birds, animals, and sometimes with human figures.

" The term ""Karma Yoga"" is derived from two Sanskrit words: ""Karma"" and ""Yoga."" In Sanskrit, ""Karma"" means action or deed. It refers to the actions or activities performed by an individual, including their thoughts, words, and physical actions. ""Yoga"" means union or connection. It signifies the process of uniting the individual self (atman) with the universal consciousness or the Divine (Brahman). When combined, ""Karma Yoga"" can be understood as the path of selfless action, where an individual performs their duties and responsibilities without attachment to the results, aiming to attain spiritual growth and union with the Divine. It emphasizes the importance of performing actions as a service or offering to the Divine, without seeking personal gains or rewards."	This combined action, where an individual performs their duties and responsibilities without attachment to the results, aiming to attain spiritual growth and union with the universal consciousness or the creator.
 After teenager Ann Somerton's father Andrew is killed during construction of the new Windsor Line for the London Underground, her mother Lilian receives a substantial amount of compensation. Ann, her mother and her mother's new boyfriend - Neville Chandler, who Ann believes is only interested in getting the large insurance pay-out - are invited to join the Mayor's party on the line's maiden train. Passing through a tunnel, Ann sees a vision of her father as one of a gang of ragged workers and faints. This draws the attention of a journalist from the Daily Globe, who begins to investigate. No-one believes her story, but Ann begins dreaming of her father, begging her to help. She returns to the line alone and has another vision, this time seeing her father being beaten by sinister figures. Desperate to find more, she visits her father's old friend Mr. Carstairs, an expert on the Underground, and learns of the old Prince Albert line in the same place decades before, which was covered up after a tunnel collapsed. Meanwhile, the journalist and his photographer venture into the tunnels, only to vanish. Ann spots a photograph of Victorian industrialist Lord Vicary in a magazine, and recognises him as the ringleader in her visions, and - despite her mother's increasingly histrionic attempts to get her to stop her daughter's obsession - returns to the Windsor Line after speaking to Globe editor Franklin, who instigates a police search of the tunnel. However, while Ann sees the two newsmen now among the workers, the police don't. After a spell committed to Stapleton Clinic, Ann pretends there was nothing behind her visions, and requests a visit to Vicary Hall, now a stately home that allows guided tours. She discovers Vicary conducted secretive botanical experiments and had a dim view of the growing worker's rights movement before disappearing in the Prince Albert Line disaster. Ann is later able to return to the Windsor Line in secret, but is accosted by the demonic Vicary before escaping with the help of an Underground worker. She follows them back to the ruins of the Albert Line. Using his botany research, Vicary and his right-hand thug Brock have prolonged their own lives and kidnapped her father and his workmates as well as others to build them an underground town. Ann is captured too, and finds Vicary is using drugs to keep control. With the aid of Vicary's abused maid Lucy, Ann is able to get to her father. The police meanwhile are drilling in the Underground as they search for Ann, having found a picture taken by the photographer that corroborates her story. Falling masonry kills Vicary as he prepares to attack Ann. The captives are freed, while those exposed to Vicary's drug are found an island where they can live, with the government covering the incident up so they can live in peace. Andrew returns to his family, sending Neville packing, and Ann has her father back.	Ann Somerton's father Andrew is killed during construction of the new Windsor Line for the London Underground.

 According to a sakhi, Guru Hargobind once chastised a Sikh for becoming distracted whilst reciting gurbani. Guru Har Rai, the seventh Guru, emphasized the importance of not even changing a single word of gurbani and taught the correct pronunciation of it. In 1706, after the Battle of Muktsar, the army of Guru Gobind Singh camped at Sabo Ki Talwandi, now known as Takht Sri Damdamā Sahib. For nine months, Guru Gobind Singh, Baba Deep Singh, and Bhai Mani Singh scribed an entire volume of the Guru Granth Sahib in a volume known as the Damdama Bir. During this period, Guru Gobind Singh preformed katha of the entirety of the scripture, as well as teaching the proper recitation, or santhiya. This exact bir (copy) was later given the gurgaddi as the 11th Guru of the Sikhs. That year, Guru Gobind Singh is said to have founded a distinguished school of exegesis, later headed up by Baba Deep Singh. Damdamā Sahib was considered to be the highest seat of learning for the Sikhs during the 18th century, and the Damdami Taksal claims direct historical ties to Guru Gobind Singh, who entrusted it with the responsibility of teaching the reading (santhyā), analysis (vichār) of the Sikh scriptures.	The Sikh Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Hargobind Singh, has died at the age of 82. It is a religious institution that has been known as the Damdami Taksal.
 Innovation in a given language, most particularly in the prose of specialized subjects, does not normally occur in a vacuum; that is, so-called nonce-formations and compounding predominantly arise in more literary modes, such as epic poetry or drama (tragic or comic, etc.).S_R: rather than technical prose. Instead, novel technical terms are introduced most commonly as a result of language contact, e.g. the influence of a source language on a target language (Ancient Greek on Latin, German on English, etc.). This novelty is not always formal, e.g.S_R: neologisms or loan-words, but conceptual too, augmenting the existing meaning of words in the target language so as to accommodate or include new concepts introduced exogenously into the target language's lexicon. This phenomenon is an ancient one, proving to be decisive in the origins of Western Europe's philosophical and scientific vocabulary, for example. Many of the Ancient Greeks' original neologisms and novel meanings came to generate continual and permanent influence on Latin writers and, thence, on local languages across Europe in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.

 Under a certain number of visitors, the marginal cost of an additional visitor is negligible compared to the cost of preserving the collection. Thus, asking each visitor to pay an amount corresponding to the average cost of the museum would exclude many potential visitors with a low willingness to pay for an additional visit. As a result, most museums have a pricing policy based on price discrimination between occasional visitors, who often have a high willingness to pay (if a visit to the museum is an essential part of a holiday in the city concerned, for example), and potentially more regular visitors, whose number of visits depends on the cost of the additional visit. In most cases, this policy takes the form of a two-part tariff structure, with a single ticket on the one hand, and a subscription offering unlimited access to all or part of the museum's collections on the other. In addition to income from admission, museums have long been dependent on either the public authorities or wealthy patrons to finance part of their operating costs. Since the mid-1980s, budgetary stringency has reduced public subsidies, while museum costs have risen as a result of both the increasing sophistication of preservation techniques and the sheer cost of building maintenance. At the same time, sponsorship is increasingly focused on operations (building construction, performances, temporary exhibitions) that provide a showcase. As a result, museums relying essentially on their own resources have increasingly turned to modest and numerous donations, in return for a policy of openness to as many people as possible.

 Barbary pirates were pirates who began their operations in the early 17th century in the Mediterranean Sea. Subsequently, they experienced substantial growth in their activities, leading to an increase in their popularity. During the early 17th century, the Dutch Republic embarked on an extensive territorial expansion, solidifying its dominant position as a major maritime power. Concurrently, it established a vast presence in international trade, making significant inroads in global commerce. The Dutch strategically established colonies and trading posts across various continents, including Asia, Africa, and the Americas, facilitating the flourishing exchange of valuable commodities, ranging from spices and textiles to precious metals. As a result of these endeavors, the Dutch Republic emerged as one of the foremost trading nations of that era, commanding a pervasive influence across the seas. The Dutch Republic displayed robust activity in the Mediterranean Sea engaging in frequent trade within the region. They established significant trade ties with countries situated along the Mediterranean coast, forging commercial relationships that were characterized by regular exchanges of goods and commodities. The Dutch's active presence in the Mediterranean facilitated the flow of various valuable products, further contributing to their status as a major trading nation during this period. The Dutch, who were known for their economic prosperity and active engagement in trade, found itself as a target of Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean Sea These pirates, seeking to plunder the wealth carried by Dutch ships, engaged in acts of harassment and attacks. Consequently, in 1618, the Dutch authorities responded by declaring war on both Tunisia and Algiers.	The expansion of piracy in the 1730s to the present day is accomplished through the strategic establishment of colonies and trading posts across various continents, facilitating the flourishing exchange of valuable commodities, ranging from spices and textiles to precious metals.

 The drying mechanisms used in drying rooms can be classified according to: Drying medium: Hot air, smoke, inert gas, superheated steam Operating pressure: Atmospheric pressure, constant pressure, pulsating pressure, vacuum drying, positive pressure drying Method of heat transfer: Conventional convection (indirect), contact drying (direct), ultrasonic, microwave, infrared, ultraviolet, dielectric or electric resistance drying. Desiccant flow method: What is being dried stands still or has occasional movements (for example, a clothes horse) The source of movement is the motion of what is being dried (tumble-dryer) The source of movement of the dried material is mainly the kinetic energy of the drying medium Mechanical transport, i.e., that the dried material is moved mechanically Linear motion (belt, rollers, chain, screw, vibration, rake dryer) Rotational movement (tumble dryer) Frequency: Periodic drying or continuous drying Installation method: Fixed or mobile	Drying rooms in the UK are often used as a method of drying, i.e., that makes it easier to cope with the heatwave.
 Incorporating elements of animation, sculpture, and sound, Nathalie Djurberg and Hans Berg construct scenarios rich in psychological tension, exploring both human and primal desires. Djurberg, since 2001, has cultivated a unique filmmaking style marked by clay animation, through which she articulates fundamental instincts such as jealousy, vengeance, avarice, submission, and lust. Since 2004, Djurberg has been working as an artistic duo with her collaborator, musician and composer Hans Berg, complementing Djurberg's animations and installations with his atmospheric sound effects and entrancing musical scores. Djurberg and Berg frequently construct mentally disconcerting environments in their films and sculptural installations. Their main characters, often depicted as girls or young women, are described by The New York Times as engaging in a spectrum of malevolent activities. These range from mild deceit and amicable torture, to curiously innocuous bestiality, and at the extreme, murder and chaos. == References ==	Nathalie Djurberg and Hans Berg construct scenarios rich in psychological tension, exploring both human and primal desires .

 “My works always seem to present a magical, dreamy, and even surreal style and it is because what I want to create is not just a beautiful space, but a spatial experience for visitors.” “Design creates value.” Li Xiang’s work involves the exploration of artistic expression, practicality, and creating new paradigms for futuristic design. The inspiration for her work is derived from her ambition to make the world a better place by making space both a beautiful and spatial experience based on the image of a world she would like to see. It is noted that Li Xiang’s workflow approach is considered unconventional when compared to other architectural practices, where the initial design phase involves mainly working digitally to allow for flexibility and rarely ever on paper.	The inspiration for this work is derived from her ambition to make the world a better place by making space both a beautiful and spatial experience based on the image of a world she would like to see.

" The story was one of several Crisis stories to be rapidly repackaged as a graphic novel, an unusual step for British comics of the time. Rian Hughes, art director for Crisis, handled the design, which included a new cover commissioned from Pleece and a foreword by Grant Morrison. At this stage the story began attracting negative attention from Christian groups, and The Sunday Times ran an interview with Dave Roberts (then-editor of Christian magazine Alpha), describing it as ""an incitement to religious hatred"" and comparing it to Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses as an example of blasphemy. Fleetway's managing director John Davidge, who had controversially blocked Crisis from publishing Peter Milligan and Brendan McCarthy's ""Skin"", ordered the collected edition withdrawn after a short period on sale; a press release stated this was due to the story being ""inappropriate"" for the book market. Purportedly Davidge made the decision on the direct order of Fleetway owner Robert Maxwell. The print run - variously reported as being 5,000 or 20,000 copies - was destroyed. The Economist ran an article on the controversy on 19 January 1991, speculating that ""no one would think twice about it"" if the story was a novel, and felt that the furore was largely caused by the ongoing belief in the press that the comic medium was still exclusively aimed at children. New Statesman also discussed the controversy, quoting a BBC Radio 4 interview where Ennis reiterated his opposition to organised religion. In 1997 DC's mature readers Vertigo Comics label, for whom Ennis was writing Preacher at the time, released a new collected edition with a fresh cover by Pleece and a ne foreword by Ennis himself."

" In 1577, William Camden (1551–1623) began his great work Britannia, a topographical and historical survey of all of Great Britain and Ireland. His stated intention was to ""restore antiquity to Britaine, and Britain to his antiquity"". The first edition, written in Latin, was published in 1586. It proved very popular, and ran through five further Latin editions, of 1587, 1590, 1594, 1600 and 1607, each greatly enlarged from its predecessor in both textual content and illustrations. The 1607 edition included for the first time a full set of English county maps, based on the surveys of Christopher Saxton and John Norden, and engraved by William Kip and William Hole (who also engraved the fine frontispiece). The first English-language edition, translated by Philemon Holland, appeared in 1610, again with some additional content supplied by Camden. Britannia is a county-by-county description of Great Britain and Ireland. It is a work of chorography: a study that relates landscape, geography, antiquarianism, and history. Rather than write a history, Camden wanted to describe in detail the Great Britain of his time, and to show how the traces of the past could be discerned in the existing landscape. By this method, he produced the first coherent picture of Roman Britain."	The 1607 edition includes for the first time a full set of English county maps, based on the surveys of Saxton and WO.

 According to legend, seeds of cannabis were brought to Naogaon District for cultivation from Jessore District before 1857 and were first planted. However, according to history, after the establishment of a cannabis hub in Naogaon, Bengal Presidency in 1906, the government of the British Raj started the first commercial cultivation of cannabis in the region Bengal. The government then appointed a registrar to collect revenue from the hub. In 1917, a cooperative society named the Ganja Society was established for the welfare of the 7,000 cannabis growers of Naogaon. The shares of the co-operative society were then sold to the farmers at the rate of ten rupees each, whereby the farmers became its partners. A warehouse was built there to store the produced cannabis. It was inaugurated in 1921 by Syed Nawab Ali Chowdhury, one of the provincial ministers of Bengal. In 1974, the government of Bangladesh signed the Geneva Conventions, which forced the government to withdraw from cannabis production. In 1975, the Ganja Society set up a 1,000 metric ton capacity cold storage facility with three chambers. According to the agreement, the activities of the Ganja Society came to a standstill in 1987 when the cultivation of cannabis was banned. After the ban was announced, the government locked up the Ganja Society's warehouses with manufactured cannabis.	The present invention relates to the establishment of a hub for the commercial cultivation of cannabis.
 After seeing the election of Tōru Hashimoto, who also went to Osaka Prefectural Kitano High School, he retired from civil service in November 2007 and decided to become a politician. He first ran for Mayor of Taishi in 2008, but lost against two other candidates in a landslide. He ran three more times for office, twice for Mayor of Nishinomiya and once for Hyogo Prefectural Assembly, but also lost.

 In 1541, 1542 or 1543 (sources differ) Portugal established contact with Japan. Japan was then involved in a long civil-war but since Ming China had officially cut relations with Japan meant that Portuguese merchants could serve as an profitable commercial intermediary between the two nations. In 1550, the Portuguese Crown created an official trade route linking Goa, capital of its holdings in Asia, and Japan, and every year one or a number of large tradeships would sail to Japan and back, commanded by a captain-major. The Portuguese found enthusiastic commercial and diplomatical partners among Japanese lords and some, like Ōtomo Sōrin and Ōmura Sumitada converted to Christianity. Instability in Japan, or other reasons, meant that the Portuguese would occasionally be drawn into internal Japanese conflicts.

 During the late 19th century, the growth of Oberschöneweide and Niederschöneweide was closely linked to the rapid expansion of Berlin's large-scale industry. The presence of railways and waterways provided favorable conditions for the establishment of industrial settlements. At the same time, however, constructing paths and roads and connecting them to the Chausseenetz of the district of Teltow became necessary. To create the first permanent link between the two banks of the Spree River, a chain ferry was established in 1885, and funded by the district. The ferry connection operated until 1891 when it was replaced by a wooden bridge in 1890/1891. This bridge also accommodated the tracks of the Oberschöneweide industrial railroad (Bullenbahn), which connected seventeen newly established factories in Oberschöneweide to the Berlin-Görlitz railroad line. The 121-meter-long bridge over the Spree was a wooden truss structure with nine openings, with three in the middle serving as ship passages. In addition to this bridge, other Spree crossings were built around the same time, such as the Kaisersteg (1898, pedestrian bridge) and the Treskowbrücke (1904), which together helped to relieve traffic in Schöneweide. However, the wooden bridge quickly deteriorated and, after only ten years, a new fixed crossing was urgently needed. The district administration opted for a steel bridge constructed of three arches of unequal length, which also had to accommodate the tracks of the industrial railroad leading to the Oberschöneweide factories. The new construction led to re-routing streetcar lines operated by the Berlin Ostbahnhof exclusively over the neighboring Treskow Bridge. The bridge plans were developed by Berlin civil engineer Karl Bernhard, who was also responsible for the superstructure. Preparatory work began in 1905, and the entire construction costs were covered by the municipality. Before the new Stubenrauch Bridge was built, there was only the Kaisersteg for pedestrians to cross the Spree and the later Treskow Bridge for vehicles, but the latter was a rather dilapidated wooden structure at the time. When the new bridge was inaugurated, it was named Stubenrauchbrücke in honor of the former Teltow district administrator, Ernst von Stubenrauch.	The present invention relates to a fixed pedestrian/vehicle bridge spanning the span of the first permanent link between the banks of the rivers and canals of the district of derivinaschneweide.
